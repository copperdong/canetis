V	 DOOROPENING
D	 Hey man
REN	Hey
D	 Good to see you

well
I see you went ahead with your plans to do a little skiing there
ARREN	 I did

ALLY
EED	Well
Im glad you didnt hurt yourself too bad
ARREN	Me too
EED	and she says youre getting better already
ENV	DOORCLOSING
EED	so thats always a good sign
ARREN	 Yeah
I mean I couldnt
I couldnt begin to X deal with X the slightest pressure
EED	Yeah
X give it X easy easy
yeah dont
ARREN	 H That still hurts back here
EED	Yeah
yeah
Well
you dont want to  stretch
see what happened
you st
Ch
According to this other guy
you stretched your ligaments in there
H and the ligaments are the things that hold your joint together
keep it from flopping around so
H if they get
you know
stretched just a little
when they try to peel down
and tighten up
and you dont want to
H  you know
get em too lax while theyre trying to tighten
You know
you want to let em  heal as strong as they can
I mean you can move it
Im not saying you got to go around with it just totally
H but you dont wanna stretch those  ligaments very much when
while theyre healing
Just
H  Just gradually bring it around
ARREN	 Okay
EED	Are you using any kind of walking aids
ARREN	Hmmm
EED	Nope
Just walking around
Hunh
ARREN	 Yeah
I had
for the first two days I had a crutch or two
EED	 Okay
ARREN	I switched from two to one
like a cane
and then I
EED	Yeah
Okay
ARREN	 Uh
it was really  icy there
so I
it had a spike on it
so I
EED	Oh
that was neat
ARREN	 Yeah
Peg it in the ground
EED	 If you forget
and walk inside with your spike
I guess youre not too well appreciated
ARREN	SNEEZE
No
EED	X Bet you X
ARREN	 No

EED	 Let me set you up there
THROAT
ARREN	Is it okay if I record this
I
I already have
EED	Sure
ARREN	 Its for a project
EED	Sure
THROAT
Sure
ARREN	 Cool
EED	 Alright
what are you doing over there
I thought you were doing something Hx  different
I thought you were working with languages in
ARREN	 Oklahoma
EED	Hunh
DARREN	 Or in California
REED	I mean
well yeah
y California your basic project
DARREN	I was in linguistics
Thats what this projects for
REED	Yeah thats
DARREN	but
I did a year of it
and decided it wasnt quite
what I really l
REED	Quite
quite what you want
okay
DARREN	Yeah
it was an unfortunate
cause I really dont know quite what I want
REED	 Well thats alright
I mean
theres a lot of things out there
youll find something
DARREN	 I hope so Hx
REED	You know

DARREN	 I move to Oklahoma
REED	X
Completely
My son is still flopping around
he
H  He uh graduated from medical school this year and uh
I mean hes in uh
Soho in New York
DARREN	 Really
REED	Starting an art  career

DARREN
REED	So
so you see
I mean
a lot of people
H you know
I mean hes gonna paint for a year
and just see whether he can do well enough with that to
DARREN	Cause he doesnt want to be a doctor after all
REED	Well
he couldnt find anything he really wanted to do
You know
I mean he
DARREN	 Did he specialize X at all X
REED	he
H Well thats what I mean
no
he hasnt specialized yet
But he couldnt find anything that just really
pulled him toward it
and so he said well
H  you know Hx
H I guess he got a lot out of always doing art when he was young and
hes gotta scratch that little itch
I think
DARREN	Good for him
REED	and
so hes up there
and hell give it a year and
see what happens
And the same for you
you got
H You got plenty of
H Theres  uh
fortunately
this day and time I think it allows
one to
proceed like youre and
youre proceeding
and hes proceeding
And I think it
I think its the right thing to do
I wouldve d
I would probably do the same thing were I
you know
another generation down the line
H You know
although I r
I didnt make the wrong decision for me
But
Im sure I would have been a lot more
Uh
uh
I guess
diligent in in
working it out beforehand but
H in
in my time
you know
you really kinda just
There wasnt too many things to do
you know
and
you  too many opportunities
and so you just kinda
H chose between a few
and
that was it
DARREN	 Yeah

REED
DARREN	 H
REED	So
a little simpler lifestyle in those days
H  Tell me where it hurts
DARREN	 Uh
still a little bit back here
REED	 Mmkay
DARREN	Doesnt feel quite normal  back there
under
REED	Okay
DARREN	 It  originally hurt
REED	On the sides
yeah
the sides dont hurt much
DARREN	It would
Not anymore
I think it did at fir
REED	Mmkay
DARREN	at first
REED	great
DARREN	 He drew some blood out
from here the first time
REED	Yeah
I saw that
You got
a little bit of blood
not too much
thats a good sign too
Cause
H usually when theyre torn bad
they have a lot more blood than that
Is that doing anything
DARREN	 Nothing bad really
REED	 Which one hurts more
back
or forward
DARREN	 Theyre about the same
REED	About the same
DARREN	Theres just this sense of constantly not being quite right
REED	 Mmkay
H Well see
let me show you something over here
Watch this one
See Im pushing back now
DARREN	 Yeah
REED	 and Im pulling forward
and it
You get a little bit of pull
coming forward it
it  moves out a little bit
and
but when you go back
it kinda
tight
Its got a good catch to it you know
DARREN	Mhm
REED	over here
H were gonna pull
pull it out
DARREN	 Wow it doesnt have that same movement
REED	 Its got a little more  forward movement
and it
kinda
has a
kind of a rubbery kinda end stop there
so uh
H chances are Hx
youve uh hurt that
uh ligament in the back too
H Uh
DARREN	 The crossband
REED	 Mhm yeah
The
Call
We call em the cruciate ligaments
He calls em the exbands
or whatever they are
DARREN	Yeah
I dont know what
REED	th they
They cross
and one
H They cross because ones going forward and ones going backwards
and they keep you from going forwards and backwards
is basically what they do so
DARREN	Hunh
REED	H Pretty logical arrangement there
DARREN	Mhm
REED	 THROAT
Yeah
it is
Your posteriors  messed up a little bit
Hx
DARREN	 Well
can that get better
REED	 Uh Hx
mm
P get a little better maybe P
Its not gonna get all the way right
DARREN	 Mm
REED	Itll be  a little bit of a problem
H Im not sure you didnt maybe have some of that before
I dont really know
uh
let me see w  how much this hurts here
DARREN	 Mm
REED	 None
DARREN	 Mmmm
REED	Good
H
DARREN	 My main physical activity
for the past year and a half has been aikido
ENV	 DOORCLOSING
DARREN	which is a pretty gentle art
REED	Mm
Mmkay
DARREN	 Lot of rolling
lot of
The knees do take something from that
X I believe that they X
A lot of work on em
REED	Oh yeah
Sure
Any of those  things gotta  H put some kinda  stress on your leg
you know
DARREN	 I definitely want to get back to it though
I had to lay off it for a while
That  hurts right over here
SALLY	Okay
REED	Mmkay
Its not too bad though
SALLY	 SNIFF
REED	 Its just very mild
H uh
that
That one could probably
See look at the difference on here now
what  see
See how much of a jiggle you got there
you got just  a little laxity there
right
DARREN	Mhm
REED	 And this ones just  a hair different
I mean it
But it hurts
DARREN	 A bit
REED	 Uh
a little bit
DARREN	 It hurt a lot at first
REED	But its just a hair
H and uh
so
if you just let that one kinda heal
you know
which I think its gonna do
cause you dont even complain much of this over here
H You know
when youre doing things
youre thinking more about this back one
and thats the posterior  exband
if you want to put it  like that
or posterior cruciate we call it
DARREN	 SNIFF
REED	 TSK Uh
seems to be the problem
H but its not uh
Im not sure you didnt have a little bit of that problem before
DARREN	 It isnt
All these years since the wreck
the  the legs never felt
you know
like it
its never been totally normal but
REED	Mhm
Mhm
DARREN	I just got used to it
REED	Did your knee
did your knee feel like it would
DARREN	GASP
Sorr that hurts a bit
REED	X
Where did that get you
over here
DARREN	Again yeah
REED	Right
Yeah okay
Thats okay
H Did your knee feel like it  had some play in it
you know
it wasnt real steady
DARREN	 I dont remember
That being a
REED	Being a  complaint while you were doing your H martial arts stuff
SALLY	SNIFF
REED	Still X hurt a little bit too X
DARREN	I injured the front of the knees when I was dancing for a while
I was dancing with Kristy Hannah here
few years ago and
REED	Mhm
DARREN	 there were some times I came down on it
and it did some
REED	XXXXX
DARREN	 But that was  impact injury
REED	Yeah
Right
Lets see  how rough that is
Let your knee down
Alright now straighten your knee out
Yeah
youve got a little
Put your
DARREN	Yeah
REED	Put your hand
You feel it
DARREN	 Yeah
its X
REED	But thats pretty typical
How about this one
You got anything over here
DARREN	X Ive got a X X
REED	no thats pretty slick
Just a little click over there
DARREN	Yeah
REED	 H  Alright Hx
Uh
hold your  leg real strong there
let me pull on it
And lets see if we got
a pretty good muscle there
Is that hurting anything
DARREN	Mmmm
REED	Kay
H Alright
well I
I think uhm
TSK H  You know I
I think
probably
its mostly posterior cruciate
not so much anterior cruciate
which is good
H um
the medial collateral ligament
that  ligament here is just minimally hurt
H  uh
I think some of that  posterior cruciate was probably already r there
and the reason Im saying that is
because it really  doesnt hurt that much when I pull on it
H See the
This is the one that pulls on that
DARREN	It feels tight though a bit
REED	 Mhm
When I push back
Im pushing on it
Thats
And
and thats not bothering you very much
But see this one
has been hurt
and when I pull on this one
DARREN	 That does hurt
REED	y it it hurts
So
I mean
you know
I mean
pretty simple
you know
if if theyve been hurt
they gonna hurt when you stretch em
you know
so
H thats why Im thinking that  posterior is probably
a lot of thats been there
H you may have hurt it a little bit more
you know
and y
So you got this one a little bit
and this one a little bit
H Both of em are a little
H both of em can probably heal up if you let em
H and
DARREN	 No need for surgery to make it better
REED	No
Unhunh
And uh
the
the outcome will probably be
pretty close to what you had before
In other words
H I
DARREN	I may have lost a bit
but its not
REED	Yeah
I mean
you know
five percent or
something
You know what I mean
you know
I dont know
You know
youll just have to
X Try to X have to see how it plays out
But it its gonna be minimal
H And you can z
You can overcome that a little bit
by getting your  muscle  in better shape
TSK There are two things that stabilize your knee
H This is your knee brace
the big muscle above your knee is the brace for your knee
thats what holds it together when youre doing things
H In fact
you know
all the sports players they
Their ligaments have been stretched so much and
repaired
and stretched
and repaired
that they
Theyre just not much good
H and they really H  have to  compensate with their muscle power
is what they do
DARREN	They do a lot of leg lifts
REED	H So right
Uh
you know just
just
uh
you can do straight leg lifts
or H what we call just those  little short extensions
just H put a  bolster under behind your leg right here
H extend the last twenty to thirty degrees with weight on your leg
like this
do little short extensions with weight
DARREN	 Mhm
REED	H and keep working up on the weight
DARREN	 Mhm
REED	 you wanna b
You
What you wanna do
and you can just do isometrics
you can just  lock your knee real stiff
and just tighten your muscle
hold it tight as you can for three seconds
and then let it rest for three seconds
and then tight for three seconds
and then rest
H And you dont have to move it when you do that
H Uh Hx
all kinda ways
So just whatever the day will al  permit
I mean
if youre sitting around
and you got some time to do some  isometrics
you can do that
and then when you have other time you can do the weights
H But  keeping this strong will compensate for your ligaments is the  plan
You know so uh
H you know
I think
I think youll find you
you do pretty well
DARREN	 Do you think I can go back to  aikido and stuff
REED	 Probably
as long as its not too  too violent
You know its more form and
shape and
stuff or its
its not too much contact
DARREN	Its about
REED	H
DARREN	But no its
ideally its about  blending
Its about blending with the attack
its not about meeting the force with force so
REED	 Okay
DARREN	 Theres a lot of rolls
REED	 Okay
mm
well
H I guess if you got good at  at doing it
you know
where you didnt
Wasnt getting yourself in awkward positions
and you know
getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something
you know
you could probably handle it okay
H  I think
I think youll  youll be able to see for yourself
Because  once you get your  muscles strong
you get this thing controlling your knee well
youll see what kind of knee control you have
itll be pretty obvious to you whether you H you have the type of control  to do that
DARREN	 What do you think the lesson should be from this
I mean

This is the first time Ive ever been on skis
I never did it before my wreck
so
I guess the less
W one lesson is Ill  probably shouldnt try skiing anymore
REED	 H  Hx
DARREN	I
REED	He

You know
if it were me personally
that would probably be the lesson Id learn from it
DARREN	 Cause Im lucky it wasnt worse
When I
REED	Right
DARREN	 It was a pretty bad fall
REED	Right
DARREN	the
The incline was about
I dont know what grade but
H there was a  turn in the wood
It was this was in the woods
REED	Yeah right
DARREN	And it was cross country
H
REED	Yeah
DARREN	So I didnt know what I was doing
my girlfriend had taught me
I had been skiing for two and a half hours
I was tired
REED
DARREN	and SM we were getting close to getting back SM
H and I got   carried away
She showed me how when youre
In cross country
when youre about to fall
you just sit down
REED	Oh
Okay
DARREN	But I didnt do it right
So
H there was a turn and then
H I
And the  skis dont  snap off of course
REED	Oh
I know
DARREN	And so
it stuck
and I kept twisting
REED	You
DARREN	and the knee took all the torque
REED	Oh
DARREN	H  And I didnt know what Id done
I screamed and
she helped me
and I manage to somehow
I dont know
S somehow managed to get up and
H hobble  on the ski pole
all the way back to the cabin
REED	 Oh my God
DARREN	and then we had to call the uh
s the ambulance to take us sixty kilometers to H Oreille
which is a ski resort
REED	 Geez
DARREN	We were in the middle of nowhere
H Hx H
REED	 Hunh
DARREN	 Im a little
I I think its been three weeks now
I
I was hoping that
you know
you told me or
doctor Smith told me that you know
with chronic osteo it could come back from impact
and I was
And I really hope this is not the time
you know
Ive made it  how many
REED	Ah thats  unlikely
DARREN	 Ive
I have not spiked any fever or
or seen any signs of
REED	Yeah
No its
it looks pretty good
DARREN	I think I may have gotten lucky
REED	 Yeah
if its not hurting up there
the pain would be H probably your first warning sign
And you know
DARREN	If that ever happened
REED	Right
You could start  feeling some H  change in the Hx  the status quo
you know
Changes
DARREN	I still feel
REED	 Yeah
DARREN	It feels  b  pretty much like the other leg
I mean
REED	Good
Thats great
Wonderful
DARREN	Solid
REED	 Great
DARREN	 Well
REED	 Love it
Well Im glad you didnt hurt yourself
its a  cheap lesson
Right
DARREN	Thats right
REED
SALLY
DARREN
Id say so
REED	 H Yeah
I
I was out
We were out
and the kids were  skiing
you know
and I was watching em go down
and I WH was thinking
God that would sure WH be fun
You know
And then s
just barely my common sense  won out
and I decided not to do it
but you know Ive had  two discs taken out of my back
my neck fused for a bad disc
H I dont need to go  flumpitybump down the hill
You know
I dont need any of that
so
H  you just have to
Hx
have to kind of draw a few lines
DARREN	Mm
REED	but I came close to
DARREN	 Its tempting
REED	to trying it
its tempting
Its very tempting
DARREN	It was fun
I can tell you
till I fell
REED	Oh God
Its
Its just great
You know
but
H then Id have to pay for it for the rest of my life
but I didnt know whether I wanted to do that
DARREN	Not a fair trade
REED	COUGH
Not a fair trade
SALLY	X No X
DARREN	I wouldnt do it
REED	 Ch
DARREN	thats bad odds
REED	 Good to see you
Come see me
You know whenever youre in town
DARREN	I will
REED	 And uh
H let me know what you get into
Im sure itll be something fun
DARREN	 I hope so
REED	 I think it will
See you
DARREN	Byebye
REED	Okay
SALLY	 Okay
Just  let us know
if you need anything
DARREN	 Okay
SALLY	 Okay
