But
H X But X anyways
back to the  the first thing
Okay
what we were talking about was
Yeah
H
Ive gotta pick up Pat
Hx
I l
I dropped her off at the bookkeeper
WRITING
H Uh
TSK Uh I would prefer that WRITING
that you were there  on one hand
because I think that it would be most expedient
But I think
H  what was  felt
was that at this point
rather than ha
than create H
TSK I dont really f find it to be
you know
a  confrontation
by any means
but
H
D   	Mhm
L   	I just think
they wanna be able to just kind of    figure out
I think our board eh
quite frankly we have more  problems to resolve interior
than we do  H TSK outside of it
D   	 Hm
L   	   I think most of it is just attitudes
D   	Hm
L   	H  I think
you know
like I said
what we need to do
is this board has to realize
in my opinion that
that they have to come to grips with
H the fact that they are responsible
for basically what theyve created
D   	Mhm
L   	Okay
You know
H
D   	Mhm
L   	You cant th penalize somebody for  m
D   	                            H And the Vetters are  somewhat responsible
L   	                                                                     H Thats right
D   	H  and thats uh
L   	X Mhm X
D   	well it was far beyond our control
L   	                           TSK H Well
and the thing is I mean
D   	H That uh
L   	were were a different board
We are not the same
D   	   Yeah
L   	And we have to do that
D   	H Thats right
L   	but we have to realize that theres
H the faults here
we have to claim responsibilities
H I mean
D   	    Mhm
L   	I think there was
theres manners of of speaking that I was very outspoken about
at this meeting
you know
w that I talked  to H  uh Bill and Carmela and Nancy about
you know
and they
X
we did
they asked me to meet with them about  Teresas thing
D   	 Mhm
L   	   H
that  I find v really
nothing
to be honest
nothing of any validity
D   	                  H Well I
you know
L   	 Okay
D   	I have spoken twice with Teresa
L   	              Did you
Unhunh
D   	   Yeah
L   	 H
D   	      And I told her exactly
well
i t I simply told her what
H what I know  to have happ
and I
its
to me its n just ludicrous
and I
H anyway
we
w we went through the whole thing
and
H uh
and and I also said
that it would probably
be brought up
at board retreat
or
DI dont know
Uh
HIL   	H Well I
Im gonna write a letter to Teresa
RAD   	H Uh
THROAT H  um H
HIL   	just to tell her that l
you know
d Thank you for your l
you know
y what youve done for the board and so forth
RAD   	  Mhm
HIL   	and just say
you know
Im hoping
we are gonna address  this  letter of concerns that youve given us
H
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	 Um Hx
shes asked Hx that
you know
she want
she didnt really want her things to be kind of everywhere
You know those th
RAD   	   Mhm
HIL   	what her comments
She really wanted em to be within this TAP p committee TAP
H
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	  my f
RAD   	Summarized
or X something like that I guess X
HIL   	       S they were her summar
her summary
th you know
She
kyu very m very concisely
RAD   	   Yeah
HIL   	I dont know if she put it together
or if nancy put it together
But
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	H you know
that just says
they
I d
I really had a ho
everybody there
including  Nancy
H
RAD   	 Mhm
HIL   	    You know
Uh had very  little  to to H
you know
to agree with the validity
Okay
RAD   	   Yeah
HIL   	It was a matter of
I just dont
you know
see  where this is coming from
RAD   	           Yeah
Its
H
HIL   	   H Okay
you know
these are
these are rooted
RAD   	I know
Jeez
HIL   	obviously in a personal  H issue
H
RAD   	   Yeah
HIL   	 Um
Teresa is a very sensitive person
she f
you know
I dont
I have no doubt that she believes
what happened happened
H But
RAD   	    H Well but
HIL   	My  my feeling is
as I told them
I said
H if its that issue
I says
you know
I said lets just get real here
I said
RAD   	     Yeah
HIL   	we all know Brad
H I said
we all know Teresa
I said
and I dont know anybody on this board who does not tiptoe around Teresa
Period
RAD   	    Yeah
Unhunh
HIL   	   H
I says
I dont know anybody who would even go as far as to say  anything of that nature
I said
H and
there
it was very clear
You know
She kept saying
prefacing everything with
H  you know
this is not a personal attack
This is not a personal H  vendetta
RAD   	   Yeah
yeah yeah yeah
Right
Right
HIL   	H  Which tells you
that it is
RAD   	Yeah
HIL   	Thats immediately what it said
And thats what everybody perceived it
RAD   	Yeah
H  There
HIL   	H
RAD   	Yeah
there have been some uh
Ill te
well it goes back to
if you can believe it I ha
H I know  she
there was a  a
We had a number of people  once
at a party
H uh
like half of the board
it was a big mistake  of mine
HIL   	            Yeah
RAD   	H and I know
she felt really snubbed
and uh
HIL   	     Mhm
RAD   	H and it was
and I I called her in fact
later
And I said Teresa
H Thi  this was not a w
I invited people that helped with the market that  year
HIL   	                                                     Mhm
I think it was two years ago
H And I know
I mean that wa really upset her
And jeez
If thats gonna upset her
H Uh
HIL   	TSK H Well thats  thats the thing that
RAD   	H but anyway
HIL   	that see and the other thing that Ive gotta do
too
is I wanna make sure
like
for example
H  Donnas aware that she is not gonna be at this retreat
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	 See I have not called her
but Im gonna call her to tell her  that
RAD   	    Mhm
Yeah
HIL   	You know
were having a board retreat
you know
RAD   	       Right
that its not gonna include staff
if thats what we decide
RAD   	                  Right
Unhunh
HIL   	H  And what we will do Hx
is I think
what were gonna probably wanna do
or what I would like to do
is I would like to take a day
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	 H  d during the week
and well just take a whole day
That day
And myself
H uh
if we have a uh facilitator
RAD   	 Mhm
HIL   	H Um
that that person
you and Patricia and  D Donna
RAD   	 Mhm
HIL   	and maybe one other
or two other board members would
actually spend that day and just say okay
this is what went on at that retreat
RAD   	                             Mhm
HIL   	H These X are the X concerns
RAD   	                            Yeah
HIL   	H  These were comments
these are the ones that we feel we can address
These are the ones that pertain to you
RAD   	   Unhunh
Yeah
HIL   	    H
RAD   	H I I am concerned Phil that
H  you mentioned it yesterday
That  that there may be  a number of questions
that  just cannot be answered
Without  me  being there
HIL   	               Yeah
RAD   	 I  I I think its
HIL   	         Hi L gato L
RAD   	   H You know Im gonna have
HIL   	Okay
RAD   	H Can we talk l
uh
I bet Pats gonna
shes gonna start walking back to the office
HIL   	Yeah
RAD   	H I dropped her at the bookkeeper
HIL   	 W  w  why dont you call me
at least a little bit later maybe
RAD   	                            Yeah
HIL   	and we can X go X do that
RAD   	             Can I do that
H Cause I
shell be
HIL   	Hx Ji  Jim and I are gonna have lunch
RAD   	Uh
I dont want to get her uh
HIL   	I dont know if you have plans or not
But
were gonna have lunch later
RAD   	H
HIL   	at noon
RAD   	 Sure hx
HIL   	        If you wanna join us
itd be great
RAD   	sure
Yeah
HIL   	   H  um
RAD   	 you wanna do it
where
whats the
HIL   	I
you know
I dont
my my feeling is
Im trying to
I think
H  what I wanna do
is
my my  point of wanting to push this retreat
I think it was really important was
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	 to do it to e
H  to make it sound like were taking it seriously
RAD   	 Oh yeah
HIL   	   But  to also  put into perspective
and see
w that was one point of view why
RAD   	   Yeah
HIL   	you know
Like I said d d the facilitator
in in the beginning
I did not
wasnt really in support of one
And only because I felt
RAD   	                 Mhm
HIL   	H I wanna make it sound important
RAD   	                    It would formalize it too much
Or
HIL   	 H I want
it formalizing it
but its also say
I want it to come to the resolution that
things arent that bad
RAD   	Mhm
TSK H No
HIL   	               and that what
RAD   	I
HIL   	what we
and things arent that bad
The thing is that we h do have our attitudes
RAD   	Mhm
Mhm
HIL   	H Okay
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	 We have an attitude
you know
even what Rays attitude with  with Barbara
RAD   	 Mhm
HIL   	   H is completely  unheard of
you know and Im
that bothers me a great deal
RAD   	Jeez
I just couldnt believe that
HIL   	          H
RAD   	When I heard it
HIL   	I
I had
you know
I came real close to calling Ray
and just sitting and talking with him about it
RAD   	    Yeah
HIL   	but I figured no
RAD   	        Yeah
HIL   	 Im just gonna blow it off
RAD   	        I think
hes off the board
HIL   	                  H Im gonna blow it off
RAD   	 hes
HIL   	H Im not gonna give m
RAD   	            Yeah
HIL   	you know
weve done  everything we needed to do
RAD   	Right
HIL   	H
RAD   	Right
HIL   	I think
you know
what Barbara told me was that
Dolores was incredibly embarrassed
by his display
at this time in front of her
Dolores apologized for Ray to him
RAD   	                 Really
Oh gee
HIL   	   H So Dolores is obviously aware that
RAD   	Oh gosh
RAD   	 you know
and
RAD   	H  Yeah
HIL   	she says
I dont know why he resigned
RAD   	I dont know whats got X in X
HIL   	because hes been miserable
H
RAD
HIL   	 because
w  which we know
RAD   	            Mhm
HIL   	 thats why he was kept trying to get involved and make it sound
you know
like he
and nyou know
he was trying to make it sound like
H same old complaint
same old everything
well
we didnt have any complaints
RAD
Yeah
HIL   	H I think this is one of the first years
RAD   	                     I know
HIL   	H that this has been so smooth
And I think
had we realized it
RAD   	       Mhm
HIL   	 we would have allowed him to take a break  four years ago
RAD   	      Yeah
Yeah
HIL   	H
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	 Because
and it wasnt so much
it wasnt
you know like I told Jim
I said it wasnt anything  H  that POUND you POUND did
wasnt anything  else
RAD   	             Mhm
HIL   	I said
it was a matter of
H you know
mBrad did
and Pat did
the organization
I said
which was the best thing
I th I agree with that
RAD   	      Mhm
HIL   	 I think that was the best thing to do
RAD   	                        Mhm
HIL   	It was a lot of time
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	   H  But I think
we need to
we need to d establish  duties
RAD   	 Mhm
HIL   	You know
Which we decided
And see part of what we decided with these duties is
H  just deciding
what we need  to do what
You know
Theres gonna be tasks
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	H
RAD   	H As specifically as we ca
HIL   	    H
Hx
RAD   	yeah
HIL   	See and Im  Im
Hx on one hand Id like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes
RAD   	        THROAT
Unhunh
HIL   	  You know
Pat does that
RAD   	             Yeah
H I know
H Theres
really the secretary serves almost no function
HIL   	                                         Just i th not
RAD   	                                                       You know I
its just uh
HIL   	 There signs
she signs her name thirty times
RAD   	                    Yeah
HIL   	you know
in the last f y
RAD   	Right
Right Phil
HIL   	two days ago
H Well
RAD   	H That was it
That was it
HIL   	   H Thats a problem
RAD   	                    That um
HIL   	I
you know
and I think we wanna do that
We need to say
You know
Pats been great enough to do this
and if she really wants to do it
Im not gonna  dissuade her from doing it
RAD   	                             Yeah
HIL   	H But one thing we have to be careful of
RAD   	             Yeah
HIL   	that I mentioned  to Jim
and Ive mentioned it to Pat lightly
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	Which is  to be careful about H saying things
You know
like in board meetings
In interjecting too much
RAD   	 Yes
HIL   	   Okay
H
RAD   	I know
HIL   	Because in board discussion
I mean
RAD   	Yeah
HIL   	o on one hand
as a member she has every right
To  to speak what she wants
But
RAD   	   Mhm
HIL   	H
RAD   	 H No
But thats
HIL   	          The thing is
you know
Ive just seen  some of the looks
from some of the people
you know
who feel
Q Im a board member Q
RAD   	TSK Yeah
HIL   	      H And whether
the board you know
if they dont interject anything
but whether they do or not
I think we have to be careful
RAD   	 Mhm
H Well Phil
that
I mean that goes
HIL   	   be because
where that came in
RAD   	That goes for me as well then
It
HIL   	H Yeah
it does
But
RAD   	It um
HIL   	I think whats different is
You
RAD   	um
HIL   	 youve been much more responsive in this sense
RAD   	                           I mean
HIL   	 Okay
H Pats more opinionated in that sense
RAD   	    You know I
Unhunh
HIL   	Okay
RAD   	H I
what I try to do
is  is is just respond to question
HIL   	TSK H X
RAD   	and if I need to fill in blanks
which
HIL   	Oh yeah
H Thats fine
RAD   	    You know
HIL   	That
RAD   	But
HIL   	See but that
your
your position  is different
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	H Okay
RAD   	 Thats
Yeah thats true
HIL   	Yours is in a
is a much more official capacity
because you are the one who answers to the board
RAD   	Yeah
HIL   	H
RAD   	Right
HIL   	You have to do that
And you are th can voice an opinion about things
H
RAD   	Yeah
HIL   	But the biggest deal
where I thought it  was an issue
th where I heard things about it was
H during the annual meeting
right after
when we had the discussion about the poster
RAD   	 Oh
HIL   	H When we brought up the thing
RAD   	Was Pat uh
HIL   	Pat was right in the middle of it
RAD   	         See
I
I wasnt there
HIL   	H and she was saying
well this is a great piece
and this is this
H Well
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	you know
I didnt wanna embarrass her
RAD   	   She shouldnt X have done that X
HIL   	and I didnt wanna do anything
RAD   	             I know
HIL   	But I just saw
H people kinda going
RAD   	That was out
Yeah
HIL   	You know
RAD   	    Yeah
HIL   	And
H
RAD   	Thats true
She shouldntve been in on that X at all X
RAD   	                      She shouldntve been
you know
cause thats not part of her capacity
shes not on that committee
RAD   	          Mhm
Mhm
HIL   	you know
and if she wants
H you know
basically the thing is
you know
if she wanted to be a board person
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	Thats fine
I mean lets look into b pursuing that
RAD   	  Right
Right
HIL   	H But see Im afraid were gonna lose Jim because of that
he feels theres a conflict
And uh
its definitely gonna happen
RAD   	                      H I mean he says
Theres no question about it
weve talked
HIL   	      Yeah
and maybe its right
Maybe it s it is gonna be right
RAD   	               Yeah
HIL   	 You know
RAD   	H  Well he
d
I mean he doesnt seem to
youve talked to him and Ive talked to him and
HIL   	                                     H Well
he seems to be
RAD   	      I mean he says mayb
you know
after the board retreat
now
HIL   	Yeah
RAD   	 But not
HIL   	H Well I a
RAD   	         X you know X
HIL   	I wanted him
I said I want you to stay through the board retreat
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	   I says
and the reason is
because I said we need people who know
H I said right now we have
You know
four new board members
Or five
RAD   	      Yeah
HIL   	 You know
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	   Four
whatever
RAD   	 Four new board
yeah
HIL   	   H  And
were at this point of saying okay
Uh
H  Hx  All of a sudden
H we have t all these
you know
questions to answer
RAD   	          Mhm
HIL   	You know
we have all these things that we have to do
RAD   	                              Mhm
HIL   	and we have H this commitment of time
Uh
and but they dont know
everything thats gone on
in the last  years
RAD   	They need to be educated as to
HIL   	H See this
RAD   	no
no
HIL   	this retreat
thats why you see
I think its important
Because
I mean I realized
that Id never seen the bylaws
since I was on the board until  I asked for a copy
RAD   	               Mhm
Mhm
Right
Yeah
H Now what I
what I have done though
is to
you know
any new board member that  jumps on
I send them
HIL   	Good
RAD   	 copies of the
HIL   	    H because
I wanna
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	I wanna get these  books
RAD   	        but ty
typically they  no one reads em
HIL   	                                   H Well thats fine
RAD   	H You know
But its
At least theyve got
HIL   	But I think
what I wanna do is
Im gonna
I wanna draft a letter
RAD   	 Mhm
HIL   	    Like I said which
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	  says to them you know
this is what were doing
this is the purpose of this retreat
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	H  To new board members
and
you know
board members
for a while it was
we need to find out  what it is were doing
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	Whether were doing  something right or not
You know
RAD   	Right
HIL   	H
RAD   	 Right
HIL   	   I think we are
B but
RAD   	      Oh yeah
Sure we are
HIL   	   I think
H
RAD   	Sure we are
HIL   	     the thing is
I dont
I need to b
them to  kind of commit
To  to being responsible
RAD   	Mhm
Yeah
HIL   	 And uh
H I mean I kinda hate to feel like Im taking  charge
but th I guess thats what Im  Im needing to do
RAD   	 Well yeah for
HIL   	You know but
RAD   	y  y  you do
and youre
HIL   	H  and thats  kind of why Im
RAD   	and youre present
HIL   	 Im going to assign things
RAD   	Unhunh
HIL   	you know
at some point were gonna have committees
and were gonna have
H  you know
RAD   	 Mhm
HIL   	b  people
thatll be given tasks
RAD   	Yeah
HIL   	You know
Specifically
RAD   	Yeah
HIL   	H Like
you know
I didnt need to do all this calling aro  to find a r a r retreat space
but I figured
if I dont do it
RAD   	Thats right
HIL   	H its gonna fall on you or pat
RAD   	 Yeah
Of course
Yeah
HIL   	You know
H
RAD   	And normally thats  thats what happens
HIL   	                        Thats okay
but
RAD   	I mean
uh
HIL   	You know
I Im a Im a
Im aware of a lot of the things that are going on
You know
RAD   	       Yeah
HIL   	I know that youre getting ready to leave
and Pats  doing things so
TSK H Id better let you go get her
RAD   	          Yeah
I know
Okay
HIL   	And well continue this
RAD   	                     Well
yeah
There
HIL   	In some manner
but we dont have to talk about it at lunch if you dont want
But I think
RAD   	      No
thats fine
HIL   	if we can
H
RAD   	   Thats fine
HIL   	 If we can go ahead and carry on
RAD   	             Um
HIL   	 at some point
you and I I think
RAD   	          Yeah
HIL   	H Because
RAD   	     One thing that comes to mind is
is the
H well the question of  meeting quarterly
is that  enough
Meaning having
H you know  the
HIL   	 It would be enough if committees were to meet
RAD
uh
If committees yeah
and  thats the
HIL   	    but
RAD   	 that
thats
that was Pauls  uh  desire
HIL   	 H TSK And I think
RAD   	              was uh
HIL   	 thats what we wanna talk ab
RAD   	               THROAT
HIL   	well talk about that there too
And say look
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	you know
is quarterly
H you know
we would we need to meet every other month
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	You know
do we need t
do we need to meet
you know
H
RAD   	as a full board every oth
H w
We shouldnt have to
HIL   	We shouldnt
RAD   	If the committees
uh
HIL   	    H but these committees need  to be active
RAD   	function properly
HIL   	 and to X do their things X
H
RAD   	Right
HIL   	Basically
you know
the publications committee
needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish
H
RAD   	Yeah
HIL   	You know
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	 They need to become  somewhat selfsufficient
Collections committee
RAD
HIL   	    needs
you know
I would like to create  collections committee to be something where were almost matching
RAD   	 Yeah
HIL   	   Funds they can raise maybe
HIL   	 Unhunh
Yeah
HIL   	    You know
If they can raise ten grand
RAD   	Well
H
HIL   	     you know
RAD   	and have some
HIL   	I mean realistically
RAD   	have some incentive
HIL   	H Right
RAD   	For them to
yeah
HIL   	So that basically theyd be
theyd get to a point of saying
RAD   	 Mhm
HIL   	    Okay we need to be responsible X with X this
so that  collections
RAD   	Yeah
HIL   	and publications will be all  fund raising too
RAD
Right
HIL   	H
RAD   	   Oh boy Phil
thats
HIL   	 Yeah
its not gonna be pretty
RAD   	Yeah

HIL   	 Because thats
Hx
RAD   	You know also
we may consider
you know

HIL   	    H Jack and I and Jim  met with him

Jacks financial friend that

Yeah
RAD   	    You know
And
Im hoping
RAD   	    H Yeah I
HIL   	what Im gonna
what Im anticipating doing is uh
this retreat  might urge people  H to say
Im not interested in doing that much work
RAD   	                                      Yeah

yeah
HIL   	H And  it might just f  get  like Nancy  and Kay
I mean I like Kay XX
RAD   	   TSK H See Nancy was going off
She
she told me she was going off this year

said well Nancy you cant leave right away
and uh
H uh
she said okay
Ill stay another year
But
I dont  know why
HIL   	H
RAD   	You know
and
and then we can
why
tha
I think thats very important to discuss
At the board  retreat
HIL   	                   TSK H I think it is
because
I mean
the thing is that we need to get to a point and
the reason weve set terms is because
basically
people here
H
RAD   	Mhm
HIL   	majority of us have been here a long time
RAD   	TSK Yeah
Thats right
HIL   	 You know
and
theres a point
RAD   	   well thats why we have this
the term limitation
