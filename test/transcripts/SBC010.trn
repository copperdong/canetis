But
H X But X anyways
ck to the  the first thing
Okay
at we were talking about was
Yeah

ve gotta pick up Pat
Hx
I l
dropped her off at the bookkeeper
WRITING
Uh
TSK Uh I would prefer that WRITING
that you were there  on one hand
because I think that it would be most expedient
But I think
H  what was  felt
was that at this point
rather than ha
than create H
TSK I dont really f find it to be
you know
a  confrontation
by any means
but
H
Mhm
I just think
they wanna be able to just kind of    figure out
I think our board eh
quite frankly we have more  problems to resolve interior
than we do  H TSK outside of it
Hm
I think most of it is just attitudes
Hm
H  I think
you know
like I said
what we need to do
is this board has to realize
in my opinion that
that they have to come to grips with
H the fact that they are responsible
for basically what theyve created
Mhm
Okay
You know
H
Mhm
You cant th penalize somebody for  m
H And the Vetters are  somewhat responsible
H Thats right
H  and thats uh
X Mhm X
well it was far beyond our control
TSK H Well
and the thing is I mean
H That uh
were were a different board
We are not the same
Yeah
And we have to do that
H Thats right
but we have to realize that theres
H the faults here
we have to claim responsibilities
H I mean
Mhm
I think there was
theres manners of of speaking that I was very outspoken about
at this meeting
you know
w that I talked  to H  uh Bill and Carmela and Nancy about
you know
and they
X
we did
they asked me to meet with them about  Teresas thing
Mhm
H
that  I find v really
nothing
to be honest
nothing of any validity
H Well I
you know
Okay
I have spoken twice with Teresa
Did you
Unhunh
Yeah
H
And I told her exactly
well
i t I simply told her what
H what I know  to have happ
and I
its
to me its n just ludicrous
and I
H anyway
we
w we went through the whole thing
and
H uh
and and I also said
that it would probably
be brought up
at board retreat
or
DI dont know
Uh
H Well I
Im gonna write a letter to Teresa
H Uh
THROAT H  um H
just to tell her that l
you know
d Thank you for your l
you know
y what youve done for the board and so forth
Mhm
and just say
you know
Im hoping
we are gonna address  this  letter of concerns that youve given us
H
Mhm
Um Hx
shes asked Hx that
you know
she want
she didnt really want her things to be kind of everywhere
You know those th
Mhm
what her comments
She really wanted em to be within this TAP p committee TAP
H
Mhm
my f
Summarized
or X something like that I guess X
S they were her summar
her summary
th you know
She
kyu very m very concisely
Yeah
I dont know if she put it together
or if nancy put it together
But
Mhm
H you know
that just says
they
I d
I really had a ho
everybody there
including  Nancy
H
Mhm
You know
Uh had very  little  to to H
you know
to agree with the validity
Okay
Yeah
It was a matter of
I just dont
you know
see  where this is coming from
Yeah
Its
H
H Okay
you know
these are
these are rooted
I know
Jeez
obviously in a personal  H issue
H
Yeah
Um
Teresa is a very sensitive person
she f
you know
I dont
I have no doubt that she believes
what happened happened
H But
H Well but
My  my feeling is
as I told them
I said
H if its that issue
I says
you know
I said lets just get real here
I said
Yeah
we all know Brad
H I said
we all know Teresa
I said
and I dont know anybody on this board who does not tiptoe around Teresa
Period
Yeah
Unhunh
H
I says
I dont know anybody who would even go as far as to say  anything of that nature
I said
H and
there
it was very clear
You know
She kept saying
prefacing everything with
H  you know
this is not a personal attack
This is not a personal H  vendetta
Yeah
yeah yeah yeah
Right
Right
H  Which tells you
that it is
Yeah
Thats immediately what it said
And thats what everybody perceived it
Yeah
H  There
H
Yeah
there have been some uh
Ill te
well it goes back to
if you can believe it I ha
H I know  she
there was a  a
We had a number of people  once
at a party
H uh
like half of the board
it was a big mistake  of mine
Yeah
H and I know
she felt really snubbed
and uh
Mhm
H and it was
and I I called her in fact
later
And I said Teresa
H Thi  this was not a w
I invited people that helped with the market that  year
Mhm
I think it was two years ago
H And I know
I mean that wa really upset her
And jeez
If thats gonna upset her
H Uh
TSK H Well thats  thats the thing that
H but anyway
that see and the other thing that Ive gotta do
too
is I wanna make sure
like
for example
H  Donnas aware that she is not gonna be at this retreat
Mhm
See I have not called her
but Im gonna call her to tell her  that
Mhm
Yeah
You know
were having a board retreat
you know
Right
that its not gonna include staff
if thats what we decide
Right
Unhunh
H  And what we will do Hx
is I think
what were gonna probably wanna do
or what I would like to do
is I would like to take a day
Mhm
H  d during the week
and well just take a whole day
That day
And myself
H uh
if we have a uh facilitator
Mhm
H Um
that that person
you and Patricia and  D Donna
Mhm
and maybe one other
or two other board members would
actually spend that day and just say okay
this is what went on at that retreat
Mhm
H These X are the X concerns
Yeah
H  These were comments
these are the ones that we feel we can address
These are the ones that pertain to you
Unhunh
Yeah
H
H I I am concerned Phil that
H  you mentioned it yesterday
That  that there may be  a number of questions
that  just cannot be answered
Without  me  being there
Yeah
I  I I think its
Hi L gato L
H You know Im gonna have
Okay
H Can we talk l
uh
I bet Pats gonna
shes gonna start walking back to the office
Yeah
H I dropped her at the bookkeeper
W  w  why dont you call me
at least a little bit later maybe
Yeah
and we can X go X do that
Can I do that
H Cause I
shell be
Hx Ji  Jim and I are gonna have lunch
Uh
I dont want to get her uh
I dont know if you have plans or not
But
were gonna have lunch later
H
at noon
Sure hx
If you wanna join us
itd be great
sure
Yeah
H  um
you wanna do it
where
whats the
I
you know
I dont
my my feeling is
Im trying to
I think
H  what I wanna do
is
my my  point of wanting to push this retreat
I think it was really important was
Mhm
to do it to e
H  to make it sound like were taking it seriously
Oh yeah
But  to also  put into perspective
and see
w that was one point of view why
Yeah
you know
Like I said d d the facilitator
in in the beginning
I did not
wasnt really in support of one
And only because I felt
Mhm
H I wanna make it sound important
It would formalize it too much
Or
H I want
it formalizing it
but its also say
I want it to come to the resolution that
things arent that bad
Mhm
TSK H No
and that what
I
what we
and things arent that bad
The thing is that we h do have our attitudes
Mhm
Mhm
H Okay
Mhm
We have an attitude
you know
even what Rays attitude with  with Barbara
Mhm
H is completely  unheard of
you know and Im
that bothers me a great deal
Jeez
I just couldnt believe that
H
When I heard it
I
I had
you know
I came real close to calling Ray
and just sitting and talking with him about it
Yeah
but I figured no
Yeah
Im just gonna blow it off
I think
hes off the board
H Im gonna blow it off
hes
H Im not gonna give m
Yeah
you know
weve done  everything we needed to do
Right
H
Right
I think
you know
what Barbara told me was that
Dolores was incredibly embarrassed
by his display
at this time in front of her
Dolores apologized for Ray to him
Really
Oh gee
H So Dolores is obviously aware that
Oh gosh
you know
and
H  Yeah
she says
I dont know why he resigned
I dont know whats got X in X
because hes been miserable
H

because
w  which we know
Mhm
thats why he was kept trying to get involved and make it sound
you know
like he
and nyou know
he was trying to make it sound like
H same old complaint
same old everything
well
we didnt have any complaints

Yeah
H I think this is one of the first years
I know
H that this has been so smooth
And I think
had we realized it
Mhm
we would have allowed him to take a break  four years ago
Yeah
Yeah
H
Yeah
Because
and it wasnt so much
it wasnt
you know like I told Jim
I said it wasnt anything  H  that POUND you POUND did
wasnt anything  else
Mhm
I said
it was a matter of
H you know
mBrad did
and Pat did
the organization
I said
which was the best thing
I th I agree with that
Mhm
I think that was the best thing to do
Mhm
It was a lot of time
Yeah
H  But I think
we need to
we need to d establish  duties
Mhm
You know
Which we decided
And see part of what we decided with these duties is
H  just deciding
what we need  to do what
You know
Theres gonna be tasks
Mhm
H
H As specifically as we ca
H
Hx
yeah
See and Im  Im
Hx on one hand Id like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes
THROAT
Unhunh
You know
Pat does that
Yeah
H I know
H Theres
really the secretary serves almost no function
Just i th not
You know I
its just uh
There signs
she signs her name thirty times
Yeah
you know
in the last f y
Right
Right Phil
two days ago
H Well
H That was it
That was it
H Thats a problem
That um
I
you know
and I think we wanna do that
We need to say
You know
Pats been great enough to do this
and if she really wants to do it
Im not gonna  dissuade her from doing it
Yeah
H But one thing we have to be careful of
Yeah
that I mentioned  to Jim
and Ive mentioned it to Pat lightly
Yeah
Which is  to be careful about H saying things
You know
like in board meetings
In interjecting too much
Yes
Okay
H
I know
Because in board discussion
I mean
Yeah
o on one hand
as a member she has every right
To  to speak what she wants
But
Mhm
H
H No
But thats
The thing is
you know
Ive just seen  some of the looks
from some of the people
you know
who feel
Q Im a board member Q
TSK Yeah
H And whether
the board you know
if they dont interject anything
but whether they do or not
I think we have to be careful
Mhm
H Well Phil
that
I mean that goes
be because
where that came in
That goes for me as well then
It
H Yeah
it does
But
It um
I think whats different is
You
um
youve been much more responsive in this sense
I mean
Okay
H Pats more opinionated in that sense
You know I
Unhunh
Okay
H I
what I try to do
is  is is just respond to question
TSK H X
and if I need to fill in blanks
which
Oh yeah
H Thats fine
You know
That
But
See but that
your
your position  is different
Mhm
H Okay
Thats
Yeah thats true
Yours is in a
is a much more official capacity
because you are the one who answers to the board
Yeah
H
Right
You have to do that
And you are th can voice an opinion about things
H
Yeah
But the biggest deal
where I thought it  was an issue
th where I heard things about it was
H during the annual meeting
right after
when we had the discussion about the poster
Oh
H When we brought up the thing
Was Pat uh
Pat was right in the middle of it
See
I
I wasnt there
H and she was saying
well this is a great piece
and this is this
H Well
Yeah
you know
I didnt wanna embarrass her
She shouldnt X have done that X
and I didnt wanna do anything
I know
But I just saw
H people kinda going
That was out
Yeah
You know
Yeah
And
H
Thats true
She shouldntve been in on that X at all X
She shouldntve been
you know
cause thats not part of her capacity
shes not on that committee
Mhm
Mhm
you know
and if she wants
H you know
basically the thing is
you know
if she wanted to be a board person
Mhm
Thats fine
I mean lets look into b pursuing that
Right
Right
H But see Im afraid were gonna lose Jim because of that
he feels theres a conflict
And uh
its definitely gonna happen
H I mean he says
Theres no question about it
weve talked
Yeah
and maybe its right
Maybe it s it is gonna be right
Yeah
You know
H  Well he
d
I mean he doesnt seem to
youve talked to him and Ive talked to him and
H Well
he seems to be
I mean he says mayb
you know
after the board retreat
now
Yeah
But not
H Well I a
X you know X
I wanted him
I said I want you to stay through the board retreat
Yeah
I says
and the reason is
because I said we need people who know
H I said right now we have
You know
four new board members
Or five
Yeah
You know
Yeah
Four
whatever
Four new board
yeah
H  And
were at this point of saying okay
Uh
H  Hx  All of a sudden
H we have t all these
you know
questions to answer
Mhm
You know
we have all these things that we have to do
Mhm
and we have H this commitment of time
Uh
and but they dont know
everything thats gone on
in the last  years
They need to be educated as to
H See this
no
no
this retreat
thats why you see
I think its important
Because
I mean I realized
that Id never seen the bylaws
since I was on the board until  I asked for a copy
Mhm
Mhm
Right
Yeah
H Now what I
what I have done though
is to
you know
any new board member that  jumps on
I send them
Good
copies of the
H because
I wanna
Yeah
I wanna get these  books
but ty
typically they  no one reads em
H Well thats fine
H You know
But its
At least theyve got
But I think
what I wanna do is
Im gonna
I wanna draft a letter
Mhm
Like I said which
Mhm
says to them you know
this is what were doing
this is the purpose of this retreat
Mhm
H  To new board members
and
you know
board members
for a while it was
we need to find out  what it is were doing
Yeah
Whether were doing  something right or not
You know
Right
H
Right
I think we are
B but
Oh yeah
Sure we are
I think
H
Sure we are
the thing is
I dont
I need to b
them to  kind of commit
To  to being responsible
Mhm
Yeah
And uh
H I mean I kinda hate to feel like Im taking  charge
but th I guess thats what Im  Im needing to do
Well yeah for
You know but
y  y  you do
and youre
H  and thats  kind of why Im
and youre present
Im going to assign things
Unhunh
you know
at some point were gonna have committees
and were gonna have
H  you know
Mhm
b  people
thatll be given tasks
Yeah
You know
Specifically
Yeah
H Like
you know
I didnt need to do all this calling aro  to find a r a r retreat space
but I figured
if I dont do it
Thats right
H its gonna fall on you or pat
Yeah
Of course
Yeah
You know
H
And normally thats  thats what happens
Thats okay
but
I mean
uh
You know
I Im a Im a
Im aware of a lot of the things that are going on
You know
Yeah
I know that youre getting ready to leave
and Pats  doing things so
TSK H Id better let you go get her
Yeah
I know
Okay
And well continue this
Well
yeah
There
In some manner
but we dont have to talk about it at lunch if you dont want
But I think
No
thats fine
if we can
H
Thats fine
If we can go ahead and carry on
Um
at some point
you and I I think
Yeah
H Because
One thing that comes to mind is
is the
H well the question of  meeting quarterly
is that  enough
Meaning having
H you know  the
It would be enough if committees were to meet

uh
If committees yeah
and  thats the
but
that
thats
that was Pauls  uh  desire
H TSK And I think
was uh
thats what we wanna talk ab
THROAT
well talk about that there too
And say look
Mhm
you know
is quarterly
H you know
we would we need to meet every other month
Mhm
You know
do we need t
do we need to meet
you know
H
as a full board every oth
H w
We shouldnt have to
We shouldnt
If the committees
uh
H but these committees need  to be active
function properly
and to X do their things X
H
Right
Basically
you know
the publications committee
needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish
H
Yeah
You know
Yeah
They need to become  somewhat selfsufficient
Collections committee

needs
you know
I would like to create  collections committee to be something where were almost matching
Yeah
Funds they can raise maybe
Unhunh
Yeah
You know
If they can raise ten grand
Well
H
you know
and have some
I mean realistically
have some incentive
H Right
For them to
yeah
So that basically theyd be
theyd get to a point of saying
Mhm
Okay we need to be responsible X with X this
so that  collections
Yeah
and publications will be all  fund raising too

Right
H
Oh boy Phil
thats
Yeah
its not gonna be pretty
Yeah
thats where
Because thats
Hx
You know also
we may consider
you know
we have one board  opening
And I
we may think about Gail
H Well Gail is very interested
and so is this
we met with another person by the name of Bill Ashby
Hm
Yeah X I know X
H Jack and I and Jim  met with him
Oh
you mean his
Jacks financial friend that
Jacks friend
is retired
Yeah
Hes a banker
Yeah
and hed be good on one hand
But
Yeah
I would like
H ideally XX Id want em both
Yeah
Yeah
You know
And
Im hoping
H Yeah I
what Im gonna
what Im anticipating doing is uh
this retreat  might urge people  H to say
Im not interested in doing that much work
Yeah
And so Im getting
yeah
H And  it might just f  get  like Nancy  and Kay
I mean I like Kay XX
TSK H See Nancy was going off
She
she told me she was going off this year
H And she uh
H
and Kay convinced
said well Nancy you cant leave right away
and uh
H uh
she said okay
Ill stay another year
But
I dont  know why
H
You know
and
and then we can
why
tha
I think thats very important to discuss
At the board  retreat
TSK H I think it is
because
I mean
the thing is that we need to get to a point and
the reason weve set terms is because
basically
people here
H
Mhm
majority of us have been here a long time
TSK Yeah
Thats right
You know
and
theres a point
well thats why we have this
the term limitation
Unhunh
XXX H
Im
I
Im uh full agreement
cause Im ready
You know
Yeah
H Ive agreed to do this term
Yeah
Mhm
but
Mhm
my feeling is
Im ready
for  a year off
Yeah
H You know
Mhm
and Ill still be volunteering
but
I really am ready for
some time to say
Mhm
H You know
and I wanted Jim to consider being market manager
even if he goes off the board
Yeah
H I know
he was wavering a little bit on that
whether or not he would volunteer
at the marketing center
H Yeah
I mean theres
Ive gotta run now
Okay
j
See you Brad
Um
but
the lun
uh
H Were gonna meet here
Oh youre gonna have x
so we can d either swing by for you
or we can decide
well call you
Oh
so X youre not X
when I know what were doing
if you want
Okay
thatd be great
Alright
XXX
Talk to you in a bit
