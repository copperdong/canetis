L	 Cool
H Alright folks Hx
Well alreet hx
ll alroot hx
ll alright
H By now Im sure youre wondering about the different things that I have on the table here
but first
H  I would like to  talk to you about these three items
I have here
H some ice in a pan
H water in this glass
and steam rising from this pot
H  Now
I would like to ask you
how these three things
Tell me please
H How are they all alike
H These three things
This ice here in this pan
H This water in this glass
and the steam rising from this pot
just yell it out
we are informal here
yes
H  Correct
They are all forms of water
This ice here of course is water
H I told you there was water in this glass
and you have all seen water boil at home
so you are familiar with steam
H But now lets try to figure out how theyre different
well look at temperature
H first
And the temperature of this water here
the ice
is
H  about uh twentyfour
nwoo
Nineteen degrees
Very cold
H The temperature of this w water here
is sixtyfour degrees
H the temperature of this steam
is
PAR I know its hotter than that PAR
Yeah
its about a hundred and eleven degrees
Okay
H Hx Fahrenheit
Okay
H Oh
and by the way guys
what do we call something thats hard
like this ice here
or a table
or a rock
H We call it a
ANY	 Solid
HIL	H Very good
You should g
you should be a choir
You should go out on the road there
like
yeah
H
UD	 We are
HIL	   H Y
Oh well
Im glad to meet you
H
Please give me your itinerary after the show
Yes
H Yes
Of course we call it a sholids
A solid
And a solid has one shape
H The shape that it starts out with
H And what do we call something that you
that you can splish splash
Take a bath in
Anything wet like soda or milk
ANY	Liquid
HIL	Youre not gonna let me finish
are you
H Yes
we call it a
UD	 Liquid
HIL	Very good
And a liquid  can change its shape
H  to f completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in
H And finally
what do we call something thats loose
and floating around like this steam here
H Or a cloud
or the air we breathe
we call it a
MANY	Gas
PHIL	H Correct
a gas
And a gas completely fills whatever shape container H you put it in
H And so
how do you get water to change
H from a solid
H to a liquid
to a gas
and back and forth
AUD	Add energy
PHIL	H Woo
I like the way he expressed that
Never before have I heard it
H add  or subtract energy
or
H heat
H change the temperature
basically
Correct
Alright
Well folks
now Im going to show you something else that happens
H When you change the temperature
and thats where these H VOX balloons VOX come in
H I have here
H a number of balloons
but
l lets see how many of these balloons
I can fit
H VOX into this little ittybitty container here VOX
Well
H everybody count together
This would be
AUD	     Theres a XX in there
PHIL	H you think
well
okay
w th th
H Im glad I never saw d Citizen Cane with you
VOX Rosebud is a sled VOX
H Okay
Well

H lets all count together folks
that was
AUD	 One
AUD	One
PHIL	H very good
One balloon going into the H little container here
And this would be
MANY	Two
PHIL	H two
Very good counting there
Two
Excellent
Two balloons going into the H little container here

H VOX Ah VOX
theyre not fitting in so easily
H VOX Oh no VOX
H So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here
AUD	X XX XXXXXX
PHIL	     H Oh stop guessing at what this is
H  Lets have some suspense here
Come on
H Alright
And this would be
MANY	 Three
PHIL	H Three
Very good
Three balloons going onto the the  little container there
Three balloons
Three
yes
the balloon trinity
H And now
this would be
AUD	Eight
AUD
AUD	    Four
PHIL	Four
Very good
At first he was confused
but then he figured it out
H Everybody tell him what this is
its
AUD	 Seven
PHIL	H VOX its four VOX

H Boy you people  didnt watch enough Sesame Street as a child
H This would be
MANY	 Five
PHIL	H Thank you very much
yes
SING Five swollen balloons SING
In
H In
H Down
Down
VOX Ah
ah VOX
H Okay
H And this  would be
MANY	 Six
PHIL	H Six
good
And lets do this uh
lets add some complexities to this here
lets do it in another language
H In Spanish it would be
AUD	 L Ocho L
AUD	        L Seis L
PHIL	        H  L S seis
N Ocho L
Oh my gosh

H Im afraid for our nation
H Okay
well
and this would be
AUD	 L Siete L
PHIL	H thank you
H Seven
Right
Seven
Okay
H And finally
this would be
AUD	 Eight
AUD	    L Ocho L
PHIL	eight
or L ocho L in Spanish
and uh L huit L in French
thank you very much
H I thought you were telling me your breakfast
What you had for b
But no
H L Huit L
Very good
Oh my gosh
H  eight balloons into this little container here
I bet youre wondering r how that happened
AUD	                                      X You popped two X
AUD	 Theres a hole X in it X
PHIL	                   H well
theres a hole
no
if youre thinking theres a hole
think again
Because
H theres no hole in the counter at all
H
AUD	Pull em out
AUD	You slowed down the molecules
PHIL	Well la duh dah dih duh duh
youre getting a little ahead of me son
H
Lets all figure it out together
AUD	X You popped them X
PHIL	H And we can get a better idea of whats happening to the balloons
if we go back and look at the water again
VOX No I did not pop them VOX
H Youre
What y what
Y
Do you heckle every scientific person
This is really terrible
H Im gonna take some of this hot H water here
and pour it into this H flask here
SWALLOW And put a balloon over the top  of the flask
H  VOX Ah VOX
H Alright
And now
I will heat up this water
Using
H VOX my Bunsen H burner VOX
Hx  H Does it use real Bunsen
Is that what youre asking me
H Alright here we go
There we go
H  Alright
Im using the fire now to heat up the water
but lets H behave like scientists now
and  watch
and observe
and take note of what we see
H Okay
TSK H Now
Folks
What do we see
Well if we look very closely
H we can see
H condensation here
H  On the sides of this flask
and steam
Rising up from the water
Going up into the balloon
H making  the balloon  blow up
Woo
dont want too much heat there
H Oh we can also start to see H bubbles in the water
H The water that was sitting at the bottom of this flask
H turned into a gas
H That had enough force
H to fill up H this balloon
H Thats what we call boiling folks
and Im sure you do too
Turning from a liquid H into  H a gas
H Now if I took the t balloon
if I took the balloon off the top of this flask here
and put the water into the freezer
H  what do you think would happen to the water
H It would freeze and turn into a
AUD	 Solid
PHIL	H Solid
correct
But it would still be water
Yes youre right
H  Whether its a solid
a liquid
or a gas
So lets think about what water is made up of
Well water is made up of  atoms
H VOX Yeah VOX
Everything is made up of atoms
H Solids
H liquids
gasses
Now in water
H two atoms of what ato uh  element
Yes
AUD	 Hydrogen
PHIL	H Very good
hydrogen
H and
one atom of what
AUD	 Oxygen
PHIL	 Oxygen
I know you wanted to say it
but  hes my pet
H Okay
AUD	 VOX X VOX
PHIL	   H TSK
A all these atoms  combine to form  a molecule of water
H And thats what a molecule is folk
A group of atoms
H hanging out
Having a good time together
H And they call the water molecule  aich two o
Alright
So
TSK Folks
TSK H How do you suppose the molecules in this water
PAR goodbye guys
I
H Ill miss you PAR
H
AUD
PHIL	How do you suppose the molecules in this water when its ice
are different from the molecules in the water H when its a liquid
and different still from the water
H  from the molecules in the water when its steam
AUD	                                       X Fast X
PHIL	 Do you know
H  Yes
AUD	Theyre not moving XXX
PHIL	                  H Thats right
its th
its movement my friends
You see
all molecules move
Not just in water
H but in everything in the universe
H VOX Even you
The molecules are moving VOX
H But to get a better understanding of how those molecules interact
H lets pretend these pingpong balls here H are molecules
H Well folks
H In a solid
H like this ice here
Or a table
H The molecules are moving H very slowly
ENV	                             MACHINESTARTS
PHIL	Alright
And theyre very close together
in fact  theyre in a v  MRC joined uniform state MRC
H Okay
they move very coolly
slowly
and thats what its like
H in a solid
Like the ice
But in a liquid
ENV	MACHINELOUDER
PHIL	 H the molecules are moving a little more quickly
Okay
So you have some  fluidity of movement within a fixed volume
H Okay
theyre a little more  further apart there
H but in a gas
ENV	MACHINELOUDER
PHIL	 VOX look at that
H Theyre moving very quickly indeed
Alright VOX
H Theyre moving so fast they completely fill the shape container

ENV	MACHINESTOPS
PHIL	 Thats what its like in a gas
VOX And temperature is a measurement of how fast  or slow  H molecules are moving VOX
So if you have H VOX slow moving molecules VOX
H what temperature do you have people
H  Yes
cold
or low temperature
H And if you have fast moving molecules
what type of temperature do you have
MANY	 Hot
PHIL	H VOX Hot or high temperature VOX
H Youre right
H But not every substance becomes
a solid
H a liquid
and a gas
at the same temperatures
H as water does
H And that brings us back to the mystery H VOX of our disappearing balloons VOX
Now inside this container here
into which our balloons
HIVOX ah VOXHI
H TSK I am losing my  spheres
TSK H  Inside this container
into which our balloons have disappeared
I have a liquid
H Im going to take some of that liquid
and examine it much in the same way that I did H the water
VOX
H Yeah VOX
Alright guys
H Lets watch now and see what occurs
H Im going to pour this liquid into this flask here
H  and again
we will behave like scientists
and watch
and observe
and see what we  notice
H Now here  is a liquid
That is bubbling and steaming
like the water was
H when there were the f
when there was a flame underneath it
But
H theres no flame underneath this  liquid here
Nthats different
H Lets see
what happens when I put a balloon over the top
H  If we do in fact have a liquid
thats turning into a gas
with enough force to fill up a balloon
and lo and behold
H VOX we do VOX
H It is filling up the balloon here
But
H  This steam here is very cold
And we can see that frost H is forming
on the sides of this HI flask HI here
H VOX Frost
H My God VOX Hx
H Thats curious
Lets see what the temperature is of this liquid
H
AUD	 XXX
MANY	LAUGHTER
PHIL	Did you guys come from a deprived home or something
you didnt have balloons
H VOX Fighting over balloons
I never thought Id see the day VOX
H Im going to put this probe here into this liquid
and we will see what temperature H this balloon is
Uh try to  stay in your seats
I dont want you guys to run up  throughout the show
Okay
now the temperature of this liquid is
H threehundred and twentythree degrees below zero
H Water becomes a solid at thirtytwo degrees above zero
And it remains a solid H at every tenjure temperature below that
So
folks
do you think
H this  threehundred and twentythree degree liquid
is  water
MANY	 No
PHIL	H No
Thats right
go ahead and shake your heads in disbelief
Of course its not water
H No
This  folks  is  liquid H nitrogen
VOX Ah yes VOX
H  Where folks can you find  lots of nitrogen
In
Hes like
oing this
I thought he had bad breath
X yes X
the air youre breathing right now
Your lungs are filled with this stuff
all of you
H  The air is probably about seventy percent nitrogen
and uh
its oxygen
and other gasses as well
H okay
Our body takes it all in
H But we only use the oxygen
We breathe out the nitrogen
The reason why the nitrogen is not freezing our lungs
H as it is doing this flask here
H is because
H those molecules are moving much faster
H The  nitrogen is warmer
Probably about seventy degrees I would imagine
H But
VOX this  liquid  is very cold indeed
Threehundred and twentythree degrees below zero VOX
H Well
to get exactly
to get an idea about how cold that is
lets use these two  bouncing rubber balls
I would like you people in the audience to
H examine the balls
To let me know if
H they are in fact
average normal everyday balls
Testify for the audience
VOX Dont bite into it
jeesh VOX
AUD
PHIL	H  Youve really havent been fed
have you
Oh Im really feeling sorry for you
Please bounce it back now
AUD	 No
dont bounce it
PHIL	              H
AUD	X Throw it anywhere else X
PHIL	H  H
AUD	Throw it in the water
X Right under the water X
PHIL	H That was
Im surprised I caught that
Normally Im  ftry to goof
Im like Michael Jordan
in the White Sox
But anyway
H but this time I caught it
H So
lets see what happens
when one of these balls goes into the VOX liquid H nitrogen VOX
Now the other one stays out here
H with me
Where its nice and warm
H  Well lets think now about whats happening to this ball
Its in the VOX very cold VOX liquid nitrogen
Right
H So
What do you think is happening to the ball
Is the ball getting hotter H or colder
Everybody say it out loud
AUD	Hotter
MANY	 Colder
PHIL	H Colder
Okay
PAR some people dont agree with you
In fact most people dont PAR
H Yes
its getting colder
H So if the ball is getting colder
do you think the balls molecules
H are going faster
Or slower
MANY	Slower
PHIL	H Slower
okay
And that  you all  concur
That is excellent
H So
if these molecules are going slower
H do you think
and the ball is getting colder
do you think the ball is becoming H MRC more of a solid MRC
Or more of a liquid
What do you think
AUD	 Liquid
PHIL	H A liquid
only one person thinks that
cause everybody didnt want to go all that far out on a limb
So lets see
H  if uh
sh
H if what this guy is thinking is true
If it becomes more of a liquid
or more of a solid
I will take this ball VOX out VOX H of the liquid nitrogen
and we will begin  the experiments
H Okay
now
Lets see
they look alike
dont they
they still look  pretty much the same
except we have steam coming off this ball here
lets see H if they bounce   as before
ENV	BALLBOUNCING
PHIL	 H Well this one  m  bounces pretty much the same
but this one is different
H That is curious
VOX Hmm VOX
H Well I must continue my study
H Lets see how they react under  VOX pressure VOX
H GRUNT
H Okay
GRUNT
H alright
this one  pretty much  is absorbing my energy
it remains intact
but lets see what happens to this ball
VOX  H  H  VOX
H  H   H
AUD	 Did it break
PHIL	 VOX No VOX
H It broke
You see
these molecules got slower and slower and slower
and
H closer together
H The ball became more of a solid than before
it became harder
H  Well folks
that  kinda k
it  gives you a little bit of an idea of whats happening to our balloons
but it still doesnt make it absolutely clear
H so
H And well see what happens to this  VOX big old balloon
When it interacts with liquid nitrogen  VOX
H Alright
Rather than see what happens tha there and
guess at whats happening to these  balloons in the container
we will see what happens H to a balloon
when it interacts with liquid nitrogen in the light of day
H Alright
Im pouring the very cold liquid nitrogen over this balloon
H So the balloon and its contents
the air inside
is getting colder and colder and colder
H Okay those molecules are slowing down
Theyre going slower and slower
H and so theyre getting closer and closer together
Okay
H You still have the same number of air molecules inside this balloon
H as you did before
H Its just that
H theyre going slower
so theyre closer together
and they take up less space
H in this H balloon
And look  at the balloon
H At the very bottom of it
You can see a liquid
H Thats the air people
How often do you get to see liquified air
but that is the air
H  The molecules have gotten so  slowed down
and so close together that
H theyre less
theyre not in the  as much in the form of a gas now
theyre more in the form    H of a liquid
H But now
The air around it
H is causing those molecules to speed up
VOX  VOX
H Ha ha
H And so
the molecules are speeding up
theyre getting further and further apart
H  and taking up more space inside the balloon
so the balloon goes back to its former size and shape
H So that has to be whats happening H to the balloons
that are inside this container here
H Alright
SWALLOW Yes
these balloons are in the very cold liquid nitrogen
H and so those molecules slowed down
H and got closer together
Hx H the air
took up less space inside the balloons
So I can fit VOX all VOX those balloons
H into this HI little ittybitty container HI
H VOX But now VOX
H Im taking the balloons out  of this container
H so the molecules  are speeding up
H The air is VOX heating up VOX
okay
And so the molecules are going H faster and faster
and theyre getting further and further apart
H theyre taking up less space
H inside
Im sorry
taking  up more and more space
inside these balloons
H  And you might want to protect your eardrums
Cause sometimes as these balloons expand
they pop
And let me tell you
I get quite shell shocked at the end of the day
H So
this really teaches us a lot people
this tells us that the difference
ENV	                          POP
PHIL	VOX Ow VOX
H  The difference in a substance between a solid  a liquid and a gas
H  like water
is
how fast the molecules are moving
And that different  substances become a solid
a liquid
and a gas at different temperatures
and temperature H is a measurement of how fast or slow H molecules are moving
H Thats what I wanted to tell you people
I love to share that with everyone that I meet
H if you have any questions about this
or  any other subject
come on up and ask
H  even if you dont
I certainly hope you have a great day here at the Museum  of Science  VOX and Industry VOX Hx
