DY	 H  You know its
it was really pretty straightforward this morning
CE	                                          H
DY	 H  And
y z
I thought you did a good job all the way through
I mean you were on top of what you were scanning
ANCE	                       Hm
Thanks
SNIFF
ANDY	 um
ANCE	 shouldve kept that one Horizon
Fauker jet
just t keep em on the right
ANDY	 Why did you switch em
ANCE	H Well
Hx
looking at something
I would get
it didnt seem like I could get someone else out
But
H um
and
part of it to provide a good service
but then
ANDY	 Yeah
H  Well
that that
I guess thats one reason the two eights kind of
well
two eights kinda nice sometimes
because
I mean when were on ten
all the departures seemed like theyre going out the left
ANCE	                                             SNIFF
ANDY	H so you really want your arrivals on the right
When youre landing two eight
H  then you can  get departures off of
almost both at any time
ANCE	       SNIFF
ANDY	So you always got a hole
ANCE	       Nyeah
Yeah
ANDY	 So
but uh
dont feel bad about keeping Horizon on the right
X boy X
because
ANCE	Mhm
ANDY	 H sure doesnt hurt them to taxi X any X
Theyre so used to having
A number one service

ANCE	  TSK H Yeah
plus when theyre departingg
ANDY	                   every one of em came
ANCE	 theyre right by the gate
H Everyone
even
even one or
one or two of em I said
Ill advise if the left becomes available
H and they said w
ANDY	    and they
they still ask
ANCE	 wed like the left
if it  becomes available
ANDY	                  H
I know
they still ask
ANCE	SNIFF
ANDY	And Viking is the same way
H
ANCE	   Yeah
ANDY	 So
Theres sh
theres sure nothing wrong with keeping em on the right though
Um
Traffic Watch Eight we discussed
ANCE	H TSK So radar service terminated
ANDY	                   um
call me inbound
or
ANDY	 H You wanna say Q radar service terminated
frequency change approved
Report back inbound Q
Or
H I I think that something a little ttle  more like thats better
than just saying radar service terminated
because
hes kinda
LANCE	SNIFF
RANDY	 Left hanging
LANCE	    Okay
RANDY	 And you could just say
radar service terminated
report back inbound
and then hell
hell either come back and say
well Im departing the area
now back to Hillsborrow
H Or Ill call you back inbound
So that gives you an idea
LANCE	 Okay
RANDY	 But uh
and uh
H   Along with that
Let TC
do more of the work for you
LANCE	 Okay
RANDY	 you know
Um
just tell her what you want her to do
LANCE	SNIFF
RANDY	H  I was thinking of a  couple  instances
where you couldve used her more than you did
LANCE	 Okay
H I was thinking that for my rundowns
you know that would
thats
that would have been a help
but
H on the other s the other hand
BILL	 I wanna get it on tape
heck of a job Lance
RANDY	  H  H H
LANCE	Oh thank you very much
Did you hear that
H
um
H
RANDY	H The problem with doing rundowns
is that its kind of over in your face
LANCE	 Yeah
Yeah
So
RANDY	Cause the Dlights kind of
pretty far over to the left there
but sh you can
you can have her do it if you want
LANCE	 TSK H Um
H I would
Im  just  working at
doing as much  of these other things as I possibly can
Because theyll be times when I wont have a TC
and just
just  challenging myself
RANDY	             And thats okay
H
LANCE	H Um
what were some of the things
other than
what what were some of the things that
H that I should have used her for that I didnt
RANDY	                            H Depending on who your
LANCE	SNIFF
RANDY	Who your TC is
if c certain people sit down there
they d
they have a tendency to do everything for you
H And sometimes that is p
that is really pretty nice
H If you just
if you just
all you have to do is stand up
and look out the window
and look at the bright
and talk
You no other w
no other coordination
or
or ARTS functions
or anything
H That really is nice
LANCE	    TSK Thats ideal
RANDY	 It it really helps
LANCE	    Mhm
RANDY	 the situation
LANCE	 Mhm
RANDY	 So
but
Right now
like you say
maybe it is better for you to do some of that stuff
LANCE	                                 SNIFF
TSK um
I dont think there was Hx
I mean I had
just a couple that I switched to the left
you know maybe three or so
that I switched to the left
uh p
uh probably two or three
H and so there was that
I didnt have any  ARTS entries
I had
you know
Traffic Watch to slue out to
RANDY	YAWN
LANCE	um
RANDY	YAWN  YWN Yeah YWN
LANCE	For the most part
I mean I was able to k
I think I was able to keep up with that stuff
RANDY	With the ARTS
LANCE	 Yeah
I mean
there wasnt really nothing much to do
H um
RANDY	No
there wasnt
LANCE	 So
RANDY	 But there could be
LANCE	 Yeah
RANDY	If theres VFRs departing
or
LANCE	 Yeah
I told her  to do my  VFR guys
RANDY	 h Yeah
LANCE	And um
to write down my VFRs
H
Thats one thing I gotta kick myself to do
RANDY	 Yeah
LANCE	 Now are we still required to w
write
like
the Empires that coming in through the gates VFR
Dont they
We are
RANDY	 Any VFR
LANCE	    h
H Now isnt that
arent they when they c
But what if theyve
c well I guess we have no way of knowing if theyve come in IFR
and then cancelled VFR
RANDY	 Well yeah
because they have a strip on it downstairs
LANCE	                                     Mhm
RANDY	So
I dont
actually
Im like you
I dont really know what the point is of that
Because we do have a record of em anyway
But
LANCE	    Mhm
RANDY	  when the
when the
order came across or whatever
X or this X memorandum that said
to write down all VFR arrivals
LANCE	 TSK Okay
RANDY	 So
if theyre a VFR arrival
youre supposed to write it down
LANCE	 Okay
P Ill do that then P
RANDY	Unhunh
H When Horizon onethirtyeight didnt answer you there
LANCE	 H  Go back to ground
RANDY	 Yeah
LANCE	    or just move on to something else
RANDY	 I mean you tried him a couple times
You say Horizon onethirtyeight
XXXXX
if they dont get the hint
if hes
H but if you cant get him
just go on
and do something else that you can do
United was calling ready to go
LANCE	 Yeah
RANDY	So
shoot
just let United go
Horizon
LANCE	        Yeah
RANDY	you cant do nothing with him
so just have him hold there
So just go on to the next
LANCE	TSK Okay
RANDY	 Next thing
and do tell ground
He might be still on ground frequency
which is
LANCE	      SNIFF
RANDY	H  uh
usually not too likely
because
you know
LANCE	    At that point
RANDY	At that point
well hes out there
LANCE	you know
Hes
RANDY	and hes probably sitting there
LANCE	                              SNIFF
RANDY	and th hes not hearing anything
Hx  from the tower you know
LANCE	                     Yeah
RANDY	hes probably
looking at his radio about then
H  Hx
LANCE	 H Yeah
I think I was a little bit rigid in my planning of that
cause I wanted to
had to plan
to get him out at that point
and
I shouldve been more flexible and
RANDY	 But uh
you know HX
everything else I saw
H you your separation was
was really good this morning
I mean you really tightened em up
Maybe a couple times almost a little bit too tight
LANCE	 a little to tight
SNORT  H
RANDY
Cause uh
H
I dont know
y a couple times you had
like one just barely at departure end
a jet at departure
and you cleared another jet for takeoff
H And it worked out great
LANCE	                         TSK Oh
One guy out the right and then
oh th
both guys out the left
RANDY	                  Both guys out to the left
LANCE	SNIFF
RANDY	H  And it worked out good
but
I think it worked out because
TSK this guy
was real slow
on  on  starting his departure roll
H  You know
LANCE	Mhm
RANDY	usually you gotta get em just a little bit off the departure end
before you clear the next guy
H And watch out for the uh
the seventhirtyseven
fourhundreds
LANCE	         Fourhundreds
Okay
RANDY	    Or threehundreds and
H
LANCE	Okay
RANDY	 Because uh
theyll really climb
And they can go fast
too
LANCE	 Okay
RANDY	 So
well you know
just take into consideration the type of aircrafts
It takes the seventwentyseven a little b while to get wound up
while the seventhirtysevenll really go
But uh

I mean it was really good
Good departure separation
LANCE	 Thanks
RANDY	 I was impressed
And
you saw
a little bit about the twosixty
Heading
Listen to the readbacks for
LANCE	H Yeah
RANDY	 H  If I know hes at twothirty
But you can wrap em around
to onethirty or onesixty
to avoid the MBA
and that works great
because
otherwise you got twosixty
H There was that one time you had
two south plan aircraft
and one  westbound
or
X river X
metro and
LANCE	Mhm
RANDY	H
LANCE	Mhm
RANDY	 I d
I actually didnt think
you were gonna have three miles between the two first
LANCE	 Mhm
RANDY	south X plan air lane X
but you did
That was perfect
LANCE	 The one that I kept on runway heading for a bit
RANDY	                                              Yeah
LANCE	or
RANDY	 Yeah
LANCE	   Okay
RANDY	 And that was good
it was real good planning
to keep that one Caravan on runway heading
when you had the other one going twosixty
To ensure that you had
oh and you had the one going twoforty
LANCE	H
RANDY	 or something
LANCE	          Hx
RANDY	and then you had the Metro going s
going twosixty
LANCE	 Yeah
RANDY	    But you kept the Metro on
X this X runway heading
Which is really good planning
So
LANCE	 TSK H Im
Im
less and less  impacted
For lack of a better word
by
these g
for some reason
with all these
um
I think
the bulk of  my planning
seems to revolve around these little guys
when I can turn em
fitting em in with all my other guys
for some reason
I mean y
H and that is
you know
those guys
having a very fec affective part
in the whole fan
of all our departures
And um
RANDY	 Hm
LANCE	 I think theyre
theyre a  affecting me less than they did in the past
RANDY	 Yeah
LANCE	   Does that make sense
RANDY	Yeah
LANCE	H  Do you know what I mean
H Um
cause i
there was a time where
I mean that sequence was good too
H but there was a time when
yeah an
it it may happen again
RANDY	 Yeah
LANCE	X Who knows X
where Ive got
the little West Coasts in here
and all these guys off the right and left
where am I actually gonna fit these guys in
and theyre all calling
theyre ready way early
And
RANDY	 Well the sequence
H uh
cant be too bad
When you got
when you can feed from charley
LANCE	                  H XX
RANDY	H and from bravo
and from alpha
You know
the sequence cant be too bad
I mean all he did
LANCE	           You got something you can do
RANDY	Yeah
All he did is send em all out
I mean you got all the West Coasts in the row over on charley
LANCE
RANDY	you got the jets in a row on bravo
and you got n various things over here
H So
you can pick and choose
You know
y
I mean as a ground control
you can just send em all out there
and then
H when they get there
then you can start arranging the strips

LANCE
RANDY	You know
the way you want
almost
LANCE	Yeah
RANDY	H
You know th
thats
LANCE	Yeah
RANDY	that
it works great
That way
LANCE	    Because you dont have to sequence em at some other point
in their taxi route
you know
RANDY	Yeah
LANCE	 Theyre b
they
e
essentially on their own  taxiway
up through
up to the  approach end
So
RANDY	 YAWN YWN So that was about all YWN
that I
you know
that I had
I mean
I was paying pretty close attention there
and I didnt  really see much of a problem
LANCE	 Oh
Thanks
RANDY	No significant problems
XX
to talk about
LANCE	 Im glad
RANDY	        See there was
S
H Oh um
dont always
um
dont insist on always saying
seven hundred
If you say
LANCE	 H Oh
RANDY	        Why hadnt you
LANCE	at some point after he is leaving seven
just wait till he is leaving seven hundred you mean
RANDY	Sometimes you can do that
LANCE	                      Yeah
RANDY	Yeah
There was a couple times
you didnt need to say it when
when you did
LANCE	It was out in the
yeah
RANDY	Yeah
Well I mean y w
LANCE	               Couldve either waited just a bit
RANDY	it was at
He was at a fivehundred climb and
LANCE	Or
he was a
RANDY	 just go ahead and say
turn left heading one six zero
Okay
RANDY	    Or turn left heading two six zero
For a Metro
I mean if you leave em on runway heading
H for a little bit
LANCE	Mhm
RANDY	theyre gonna be at the altitude you need so
but thats no big deal
And uh
I was watching Jet Speed come in
and you got Delta out in front of Jet Speed
LANCE	 Mhm
RANDY	 It seemed like you were a little tense with that but
H really pay attention to the speeds when theyre coming in
He was doing a hundred and twenty outside of Laker there
Did you see that
LANCE	Yeah
RANDY	 Yeah
LANCE	 So that
that worked out great
RANDY	   I wondered if youd saw
Yeah
I mean there was lots of room
Lots of time
LANCE	            Mhm
RANDY	He wasnt
he z wasnt flying as a normal
LANCE	Mhm
RANDY	 For some reason
he just used the
LANCE	Mhm
RANDY	Or is it uh
Exec Jet
One of those guys is usually really fast
LANCE	 H Jet Speed is th I know fast on the pr departure
RANDY	                AMFlight
LANCE	it seems
RANDY	 Yeah
LANCE	  I think
It  seems like that was the one
but
yeah AMFlight
when they fly the later jet
H Um
yeah
And I think I might have said for delta niners or to
no delay
or something like that and
RANDY	       Yeah
I think you did
LANCE
And he was actually floating at
the Jet Speed wasnt
yeah
RANDY	Yeah
you had a lot of time
LANCE	Yeah
RANDY	 When the Twins  get airborne
you got a jet X following  X
the twin twins gonna go southwestbound
H If you got sixthousand feet
and the twins climbing out of four or five hundred
you can start your transmission
then to the
to the jet
LANCE	 Okay
RANDY	Q Twin Cesna ahead is
will be turning southwestbound
momentarily
runway two eight left clear for takeoff Q
It says in sight
H
LANCE	 Just X didnt wanna be X sure he gets his turn in
RANDY	 Mhm
H
LANCE	   Okay
RANDY	The Caravans coming across
if you wanna get Hx
LANCE	H Yeah what do you say
Cause Ive heard different phraseology
and I af  feel like I was stumbling over that
I think I said it
couple different ways
RANDY	 A mile west
or something
Ill I just say
H   you know on a day like this
its so easy to see em
I would just say the Caravan ahead
is southwestbound
Q Runway two eight left
clear for takeoff Q
And and theyll
a lot of times theyll say uh in sight
If they dont say in sight
theyll say
theyll Hx
I would assume they have em in sight
because they wont go
LANCE	 Mhm
RANDY	Unless they seem em
I mean thats important to them
to see the traffic
but its safe
its a safe operation
H Because
ne thing
Hx you could do
is is turn the  Caravan to twoforty
H
LANCE	 Mhm
RANDY	To get him across
And then
just before you ship em
send em back to twofifty XX something like that
LANCE	 Hm

RANDY	SNIFF
Cause the tracks what im  whats important
But
but twofifty was working out fine today
Fifteen degrees and a mile
Is what you need so
or less
using visual
LANCE	 Yeah
In fact it was a
Was the West Coast that
was it the Horizon who said he could  do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead
or was it vice versa
one of the two
ENV	 PHONERING
RANDY	Yeah
LANCE	And at that point I said
dont need it now

They got it
RANDY	 Somebody in there
LANCE	I think Laura went in there
yeah
BILL	 Comm
line for you
XXX have a call on the other line
RANDY	 This is Randy
Okay
Mbye
