H  And Ill be working till nine oclock

theyll be pretty  happy for me
more or less
because uh
they didnt want me to work in the factory much longer
FRED	 Yeah
I know
My mom doesnt know what to do to get me out
H But
they didnt take a trip through
Brazil
and Argentina
RICHARD	I dont know
I dont know they they

that I got a new career going

FRED	 H They werent all heartbroken about
you know
Jeanie and that
RICHARD	 TSK Well they have no idea whats happening right now
FRED	They must have been
They have no idea XX
RICHARD	When they left
we were on shaky grounds
but
you know
they thought it might be able to work out
So when they come in
theyll be pretty shocked
FRED	 Yeah
RICHARD	And
and hurt
But uh
like I say
things  will work out f for the best
FRED	What about her folks
Theyre not sorry at all
huh
RICHARD	No uh
in fact Ive seen em
I
I w I went to church with em
for the last three Sundays
FRED	Really
RICHARD	 With Jeanie
FRED	Wow
RICHARD	 She thought it might
you know
help our relationship as friends
and uh
FRED	 H She still considers you man
Hunh
RICHARD	Exactly
She does
because I mean
we went to church together
for the last three Sundays
FRED	 Yeah
RICHARD	H and then
then we went to the movies after
and her her folks were at church
and
you know
n afterwards
her mom
w had a injury on her leg or something
she wasnt at church last Sunday
we went to the
to their house
And uh
I went over there
and her brother was there
her nephews and nieces
her sister
H our godson
H  And uh
you know
it was just like
everybody was real  friendly and everything
FRED	Yeah
RICHARD	 TSK I dont know if the parents are aware
that we did
you know
FRED	Break up
RICHARD	separate
but it
possibly was for the better
cause they
they didnt feel comfortable with us living together anyhow
FRED	Yeah
right
thats  not looked on  too good  hunh
RICHARD	No
So
w what they
what they probably  think is
you know
that we still have a lot of love for each other
H That
moving out was the best thing
FRED	But sh
RICHARD	until we both are ready  for marriage
and if she  still loves me
and I still love her
and
H  we wanna get married
theres still the  chance of us getting back together
and  getting married this time
FRED	 Yeah
RICHARD	 TSK H So I mean it
I think things are working out pretty good
She called me the other day and uh
you know
she calls me and talks to me
and I call her and ask her how her day was and everything
FRED	 Yeah
H  What
what does uh
your  sisters say
RICHARD	 N they tell me to stay away from her
dont even call or anything
FRED	 Yeah
RICHARD	Wait till she calls you and everything
But
you know
thats not right
FRED	 Yeah
Thats hard man
RICHARD	I mean
if she accepts me calling her
and she doesnt tell me
VOX dont call me VOX or
FRED	H Theyre telling you that
why
To
like uh
RICHARD	Cause they feel that
shes gonna get too strong
by me
you know uh
kissing her ass
FRED	Oh
RICHARD	or something or or or
FRED	Exactly
RICHARD	crawling back
FRED	I see
RICHARD	and begging her
you know
FRED	H
RICHARD	for me to come back or
FRED	She gonna get the upper hand
RICHARD	 Exactly
Which
which
you know
she probably already does
But
H  um
FRED	Yeah
RICHARD	 TSK Im not gonna just  wait for her to call me
because its not right
I have feelings for her
I wanna know
you know
how shes doing
FRED	doing
RICHARD	Im gonna communicate with her
Thats all there is to it
Its not like I w
H Im asking her
you know
let me  move back in or
you know
Im sorry I
FRED	You just
Yeah
RICHARD	I just wanna remain friends with her
and find out how shes doing
FRED	 Yeah
RICHARD	 So they
they tell
I dont tell em I call or nothing
You know
and uh
TSK And I sent her flowers last week
I sent her flowers to work
FRED	TSK Yeah
RICHARD	The day before I moved out
FRED	H
RICHARD	Just to tell her I was sorry about everything that had happened
and that uh
you know I hope  we could remain friends
and that  God brings us back together
if it was meant to be
FRED	 Yeah
RICHARD	 And she was real happy about this
She said that really meant a lot to me
You know
That you did send me flowers
and uh
FRED	 And then
Then the
and what you wrote
RICHARD	 Yeah
exactly
Cause she knew it came from my heart
no matter what
Id put her through and everything
she knows deep down inside
I really did love her
but I had a problem or something
FRED	 Yeah
H You had to get something out of your system
RICHARD	X And X

H filling out a contract
and uh
basically paperwork
which is f  very simple
That
you know
once it comes along with experience
and the more people I work with
the easier it will
itll be
thats the most important thing and
and selling them the car
talking to H somebody in
to buying a car
that doesnt wanna buy
Tha thats there to look
FRED	 Yeah

FRED	 Thats right
RICHARD	 And youve gotta talk em into it
you gotta sell it to em
