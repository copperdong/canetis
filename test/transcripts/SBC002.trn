w can you teach a threeyearold to tap dance
I cant imagine teaching a
Yeah
ally
H
Who suggested this to em
have no idea
It was probably my  sisterinlaws idea because
I think they saw  that movie
Tap
X X
What was the
X They had X
the movie with that  really hot tap dancer
Oh that kid
He was actually here two weeks ago
and I missed him
at the  at the jazz  tap thing or whatever
Was he a little kid
No hes sixteen now
H No hes like
Yeah hes a teenager
but he teaches these classes in New York
X That X boy
hes supposed to be awesome
Yeah
Really fast
Hm
But Im sure that was the  the impetus
Have you seen him
No
I just read an article on him
You  you probably read the same Examiner article I read
Yeah
probably
yeah
talking about how Gregory Hines said
he doesnt realize a human being cant tap that fast
Right
Right

Yeah
And they were talking about how
hes teaching these classes
Hm
and I guess he really goes fast
X And X
Yeah
H he k
He doesnt explain anything precisely
He has to double it down to like one fifth speed or something
before they can g pick it up

Well Im sure Thomas is all over it
Probably XX XXX
I mean he has a bro
XXXX could have seen him
I guess that means his broken leg is doing okay
I was wondering about that
I was imagining he had broke an arm or something
HI Oh yeah HI
But it was his leg
Yeah
Thats like
X I guess X that he was being hauled around in a little wagon and stuff
Right
He healed very quickly
X Guess X kids bones
just like  grow back really fast Hx
Mhm
Yeah
I think theyre really soft to start with
Theyre made of rubber
Th thats it
Thats why b
little kids usually dont break their legs anyway
Cause theyre so XXXX
Cause theyre made of rubber
But they have more cartilage than w
you know
Yeah
arent they real s
arent their k  legs pretty soft
Yeah
theres less calcium  deposits X in them X
And also
Mm
theyre still growing
And the way  bones grow is
you make cartilage
and then you deposit calcium in it
Oh
and then that turns into hard bone
So thats why they always have  more flexibility
Cause as theyre growing
Hm
youre making cartilage
So it al
Mhm
They always have that
until they reach adulthood
in which case
They get old and cranky like the rest of us
it stops

Unhunh
SNIFF
and then they break
Old and rickety and brittle
Mhm
Mhm
uncoordinated and  unflexible
Right
Stiff
Inflexible
That too
What are you planning on doing with dancing

In fact I was getting ready to say

As compared to the other stuff
for some reason it sounded like it was out there
or kind of  coming in from some place
Unhunh
Hm
Hunh
Well that would be nice to have a little jazz band next door
Right

No
Mhm
Usually we just have really loud salsa parties across the street

So I  thought oh shit
Id better try to wipe that off
so I  I got
I went and got a wet rag and wiped it off the car
And it came off really easily
And then I saw there was like this tube of it
But it was paint
H This whole tube of it across the street
Those kids are just

GROAN

Yeah but now youll have both
Yeah right
Probably be like
VOX shut up you ki VOX
you know
XX
Oh God
I feel
I s feel like such an old lady
But I
they just really annoy me
SIGH kay
Hunh
New subject

Hm
H
Well its cause they have no respect
P Yeah
I guess so P
Those two top masks
there
Yep

We need a verb
I guess the ones below are women

H
Is that why they look so different
H
Uhoh
I mean
i
Well you see their eyeballs
I guess
Right
Yeah the other
In addition to a mustache and a beard
But the thing is
that second one looks like the guy who was in one of the Oba Oba skits
Do you know those
any of those dances
All of em
All of em
TSK H
The little what
Looks like
the second
X Why X
one from the top looks like a guy who was in the Oba Oba k skit
Whats an Oba Oba skit
Oba Oba
oh the Brazilian troop that was here
dancing
Yeah
Oh yeah
I never saw that
Look like
a real
an actual person doing it
or some kind of masks they had
or
No
Uh
the guy looked like that
Or theres a guy looked like that

Yeah

H Thats pretty good
X Just like him
H
X With the right X
I mean that looks kinda like a Black person
SM With red eyes
and everything SM
So where is this from
This isnt from Africa
is it
No
From Indonesia
But that person looks Black
Which one is it
Or do Indonesian people look Black
Looks pink to me
The
which one
The
I figure the second one from the top
Tumenggung
The second from the top
Tumenggung
Hunh
I look at that and think
yeah
that looks like a brother
Thats interesting

cause I think Indo Indonesians
think H
or
people whove been to Indonesia
think that those guys
like the two top ones
have really European characteristics
compared to Indonesians
Uh
Just cause their eyes are real big and their noses are big
Their eyes are round
Oh really
And Indonesians have real thin eyes
and
and flat noses and stuff
P I dont know P
Except those
well
I dont know
the
the bottom ones dont have flat noses either
Thats X true X they all have b
they all have big noses
But they get bigger as you go up anyway
What do you think makes em look African
Their mustaches
Is it the
the way their little beard goes

Oh no
Thats not even relevant
I d
I just glanced at that
Hunh
and I immediately saw this guys face in Oba Oba
Yeah
Hunh
P Thats interesting P
He looks like  that guy
Poor guy
That is really interesting


H
Yeah
Bulging eyes
Cause I remember
he came to Bahia after one of his shows one night
s kinda funny
Wow
Well the top guy has a real thick lip
Oh in his black leather jacket and his black
Mm
Klana has a real thick lip
hood hat
Right

Pretty bad overbite too
Hes in Oba Oba
you know

smoking
He didnt
Yeah
H
Then he tried to
He danced with  a friend of mine
Yeah
what happened
But she didnt wanna dance with him anymore
X I X said
boy
he just wanted to get close to me
Oo
Oo
Mm
I said
well
cant blame him
Oba  Oba

myeah
Gross
Mm
But Im sure those guys get a lot of attention from women
They travel all over the world
Im sure a lot of women throw themselves at em
so thats what they expect from women
A lot of groupies
Yeah
Fringe benefits
Hm
H
The only fringe benefit X of X being a dancer
probably
Well in San Francisco
But then again
you never know if its a benefit or not
either
Thats true


I didnt know this
but apparently in  Brazil
they have a very very high AIDS infection rate
Really
Oh
Oh
probably X
Its supposed to be  very high
Mm
You mean like
Very unmonitored
higher than the United State
too
Higher than around here
SNIFF Thats what Ive heard
Hm
P I wouldnt be surprised P
Have you heard these figures
that like
um
its something like forty percent of males
in  the Bay Area
are supposed to be infected
MUSICSTOPS
Well
last July
Oh really
this is what
Of homosexual males
or of males
Of all males
Of males in general
This infectious disease woman
Or males under thirty I think it is
at San Francisco General
Mhm
she said that
this doesnt seem like it can be true
but she said that
ninety per cent of gay men
are HIV positive
and fifty percent of all males
are HIV positive
Yeah
Thats what she said
Fifty perc
It was some
Like
a m
half or more than half of
H and it was  fairly young men
but
were
had been exposed to HIV virus
It wasnt necessarily that they were  infected
H  Well
if youre HIV positive
its the same difference
Mhm
since they feel that
sooner or later youll come down with the actual disease
Mhm
Yeah
But thats what she said
Now I dont know if she meant the Bay area or San Francisco
X
H but those are some ferocious numbers
if one out of
Yeah
Thats X just X horrible
two guys
you meet
yeah

cause therere a lot of women out there who  apparently dont believe in using condoms
Hm
Im just amazed
XX dumb move
See Id heard that it was mainly
Really dumb
in  ts mainly urban areas
Yeah
that had this really  disproportionately high  propor
um
percentage
And then like
r rural areas
or
like
you know
central Iowa and stuff
had like  ten percent or less
of the males
had been infected
H Well I would assume San Francisco is higher than most cities around the X country X
Unhunh
Mhm
But
that just blew me away
Cause Im thinking well gee
if half of all the men are HIV positive
what does that mean about the women theyre having sex with
Right
Yeah
MUSICSTARTS
Well
But
and just talking with guys
X XX
in their twenties
WH why WH
I mean these guys
say these women dont care if they use rubbers or not
This is what guys have been telling me
Hx
you know
and Im thinking
I I cant believe that
cause in this city
with all the information available
It seems like
Right X yeah X
Stupid
people
people have the information they need
It is just amazing
that people in their twenties apparently arent
Right
Thats really scary
So I guess its time for me to become a priest

Its too dangerous out there
X Oh X
I dont know
I couldnt believe it
This  woman I knew I was gonna ask out
BR God BR
You have to be Catholic first
Her sister
whos an HIV counselor

Hx
was telling me how her sister just wont use rubbers
HI at all HI
Hm
Well where would she put them
and Im thinking

Im thinking
Well
how can you not
my sisters dont
Hx I mean
what are they thinking
P TSK I dont know P
Dont look at me
I I was just really amazed to hear that
people in their twenties
Were innocent
cause I figure
We dont have sex
growing up around here
you would  know better

And in high school
you know
they teach about it
Mhm
So
I dont know
Not only that
but they have really lewd billboards all over the Castro district
OVERHEADLIGHTGOESONBYITSELF
Somethings Hx X wrong X  H
I know
H I thought we got our electricity fixed
thats kind of scary

I thought I turned this off
X though
Its been doing
didnt I X
Oh
thats right
X But X
you did
Thats really scary then
This is salsa
right
Yeah
What what
Who is this
I dont know
its from the radio station years ago when I was  in Santa Cruz
You know on Sundays
at ten oclock
Thats right now
Kay
what is that
Kay
oh I dont know what the radio station is
They play Salsa
It begins with a kay though
No
they played this

They have a Brazilian jazz hour
Is there a KKSF
H I dont know what it was
H But it was like I went to Bahia
Whats
last Sunday
H  got there at eight
Hx  left a ten
dropped this person off at home
in Foster City
and came back
H and I X was noticing
the songs they were playing on the radio
were the exact same songs they were singing at Bahia
the b live band there
Hm
should I turn on the radio statio
You dont know what station it was on
I I was
P KKSF
does that mean anything to you P
Nope
You have to translate it to a number
I was in a rental car
so it was just whatever station it was on
Mm
H
Hm
But uh
H I was just remembering being surprised
cause
H I didnt realize
I dont know anything about Brazilian music
You go to the  Brazilian club
and theyre singing  songs
H  apparently I guess thats the popular stuff
I guess
Im so used to hearing those songs
cause Ive heard em for the past three months
I didnt think anything of it
but then
H this guy played songs for a whole hour
and it was like
H eighty per cent of those songs Id
that band had sung that very night
Mhm
SNIFF
Pickup bands pretty good there
Viva
Well they have a different band every night
Who was it
Viva Brazil
Oh
I went on the
X
Friday night
so maybe it was different band
Um when did you do that
SNIFF
Oh
a while ago
The dance floors too small in that place though
Its really annoying
P I like this song P
H Are they  teaching  any more lambada
at uh
school
Yeah
Vivian was giving a lambada lesson
Cause uh
when I was there X the other day X
well
my lambadas definitely getting better
Really
Really
I wanna go out lambada dancing with you
XX
I mean Im gonna start dancing with those Brazilian women
So I can learn how to beat my hips
I mean
H cause their  their hips are SLAPPING beating up against you
you know
like that fast SLAPPING
X
H Hundred cycles per second
or something
H  H
H
I mean
I am not kidding
It
It is a different sensation entirely
H

When youre dancing with them
I bet
H
And the
only way to learn how is to dance with them more
Thats true
But I feel like I can start dancing with them now
But uh
No th
I dont
I dont
They havent done anything recently
H I
I cant remember if theyre going to
Cause
like
Sue Swing taught that class for two months
May and June
and uh
Is she a good  lambada dancer
I cant imagine her being a
Yeah but
I didnt feel like she taught it any different
significantly differently than when Vivian and Jeff taught it
I mean
cause they do it
real basic
and real simple
different
than Brazilians do it
Yeah
I mean
I dont know what those Brazilian women are doing
What are they doing
but their hips are like
Are they going
are they going like
H really fast
I mean are they going one two three
I mean
one two three
first you had this wide sway of their hips this way
and then
its like
SLAPPING theyre  coming
I mean
theyre beating me like HI this SLAPPING
I dont even know how you can do that
Youre dancing with them
SLAPPING theyre beating you just like this HI
SLAPPING
Using their hands like that


No
using their  pelvic bones
Wow
Mm
Right here
Yeah
Sort of like Tahitian dancers or something
Yeah
X You know X
close
But I tell you

but anyway
you know
they werent teaching it that way
X X
You know
the ballroom people dont do it that way
XX XX
But thats what I want to learn
Dont
Dont they teach
H dont they teach you to go
one two three
one two three
one two three
like that
H Or do they go like really fast like that
Well Sue Swing
I mean when she was teaching was definitely more sedate
and the same thing with Jeff and Vivian
Viv
Yeah
It was just Jeff and
sure
but thats cause its for s
its for people who cant move their hips
Right
I mean its for basic
you know
this is a beginning lambada class
or intermediate XXXXX
I dont know why they did it that way
I mean
it seems to me if X theyre gonna teach it like what you do X

Or what they teach
and what happens socially
could be two different things
You know
I mean
Brazilians definitely dont
hm
do it like that
I should
I want to go
I should check it out
I like that
cause its fun
P X X P
I mean after I f
I mean X I X
X Are you X
Do they still teach at Bahia on Sunday
night
Oh yeah
SNIFF In fact I would have gone today
if it wasnt for my back
Hx
Well I finally found some people there I can dance with
So that helps
Do you need a partner
To go there
Yeah
No
Besides
you

I mean if youre a guy
If
If youre a woman
I mean
those guysll be all over you
X I swear it X


Dont say that
D 	              Run along now
Harolds in the room
D 	dear
H

H SNIFF  You could come too
H Well I dont necessarily  mean
in a bad way
even though Im sure there are a few there
Im not dancing with guys
All I can say is
the women arent all over me
Darn
D 	      Oo
H But


H
H
but I remember
like I went there with this person
H
H  its kind of funny
th this person did not want to dance
So shes just gonna watch
So
H every once in a while Id get up and dance
and its like
when Id come back
I mean there was some guy there
sitting in my chair

Every time I got up
Im thinking
God
these guys dont waste any time
I mean
you turn your back
and theres somebody moving in
H Hx
X I mean I dont know if they X X X
H Maybe Harold you should come with me
D 	 Why
So I can find
learn some lam  lambada

D 	 find some girls with empty chairs next to em
H
H

D 	 Maybe I should go with Miles
Oh did

Yeah
you guys could be partners
did
What
Well I dont know if I told you
told you that story about that woman
who uh
went after that guy there
I told you that story
right
I was there Sunday three  four weeks ago
Uh
after the class is over w
over with
Im sitting down at a table
theres a woman from
who was in the class
and two men
sitting to my right
is a table with two women there
They had apparently just come from Oba Oba
on the last night
XP Oh I think you told me X
the last night
Yeah P
And like
X well X they were attractive women
the one had on a real real short skirt
H Anyway
there was this guy in his fifties
out there dancing
BR by himself BR
And the woman was just looking at him
making eyes
then she went out there
got on her knees
in front of him
in this skirt thats this short
H takes her hands
and goes along his toes
and then up
and is just  doing like that
I figured
Oo
oh
they must know each other
Oo
D 	 very well
in fact
Mhm
Gross
Thats what I assumed
And
they did that for the whole dance
and I mean
she was d all kind of suggestive stuff
and touching him and everything
people would like  cheering
CLAP
and clapping
Q go for it Q
And all this kind of  HI thing HI
The  the song ended
the guy set down
at another table
And she  set down
at a
at the table with her woman friend
They never danced again the rest of the evening
D 	                                            Hm
This is like




so I was thinking
this womans sitting  about as far away from me as Jamie is
H And I was thinking
hm
this is interesting
H I wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her
No sooner did I think this thought
guys were over there
H
D 	 What
you didnt ask her to dance
Not Miles
hes just X in daze X
Well I was still trying to figure out

surely they must know each other
I mean
why wasnt he sitting at her table
H  You mean
you werestill thinking about it

H
Anyway
this guy
H
I mean he comes over there
immediately afterwards
the same guy who got his
the same guy whos
D 	    No
its just some random guy
Or just some random guy
No
a random guy
who was like sitting about where you are
D 	 Yeah
He was sitting there
there were two guys sitting at a table right where you are
And then these two women are sitting here
H So uh
he comes over there
and is talking with that woman
I dont know about what
but then like ten minutes later
she and her friend are over at their table
And then
twenty minutes later
they were kinda like  all over each other
You know
kissing
et cetera
et cetera
H And I was thinking
it looks like
these people arent going home alone tonight

D 	 Gosh
But I just thought that
D 	no wonder they forbid this dance
JMPLAUGHINGSEC
So
H  Oh my God
what a story
Well
maybe I shouldnt go there then
D 	 Yeah
maybe you shouldnt
It it it was interesting
TSK H No
I X went X there before
it was fine
it was really fun
D 	          You were there before
Yeah
I went out there before
D 	 Oh
Without even telling Harold
D 	 Without telling me
You knew
X If X I was going out dancing
D 	            Oh
Oh
I did
Remember a few months ago I used to go out dancing
every now and then
D 	Hmm
I dont remember
Well the thing that gets me
I meet this
to Caesars
and stuff
SNIFF CLICK CLICK CLICK  I meet this psychotherapist
who tells me shes addicted to this dance
which I th
think is a  interesting choice of words for a psychotherapist to use
H  But uh
shes married
and apparently shes there  without her husband
She has her wedding ring on
And its like shes with this guy
and theyre kinda like all over each other Hx
And Im thinking
well
I guess thats her husband
Uhoh did you say something
but I

but I was thinking
H but the thing is
you know shes kind of all sophisticated and everything
and Im thinking
you know
this guy
I cant  really believe that guys her husband
So I dont know whats going on here
And of course later on I find out
thats not her husband
H  HI So
Im thinking
you know HI
I dont know whats going on here
H
H But uh
Hx
bizarre
Gossip
But then she tells me
gee I dont know what it is about this guy I mean
H Ive been trying to tell him I dont want a sexual relationship with him
and Im thinking
from the way they look
when Id seen them three weeks before
it looked to me like they had one

Im thinking
you dont do that with
So
This is all at Bahia
strangers
All this stuff happens at Bahia
Yeah
Hunh
To other people I mean
HJPLAUGHINGSEC
H Hx
Well
X
I mean maybe
D 	 That was actually very profound
Yeah
that was
H
Maybe you can just go up to a woman
and
you know
do that kinda thing
D 	Yeah
You
You wind up getting punched
Mhm
D 	is whatll happen

Probably
somethingll land in your mouth
Well
it sounds like there you wouldnt be though
H
What
Yeah

H
I really
was wondering what that guy was thinking
He must have been
j since he didnt know her
HI that must have been quite a shock HI
That was really weird
That sounds really weird
I mean
youre
y y fifty year old guy
and
some  twentyyearold woman comes up doing that to you
uh
HI what do you think HI
H
D 	 I think you think
