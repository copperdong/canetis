So you dont need to go  borrow equipment from anybody

to do the feet
Do the hooves
H YWN Well
were gonna have to find somewhere
to get
Hx  something Hx YWN
So
Mae
Im gonna Hx
Mae Lynne XX
H Were not gonna do the feet today
Im gonna wait till like
early in the morning
to do those
cause y
I mean you get so tired
H  n you just
it takes
well
it takes me longer than most people
cause you know
Im not as strong and
H  and Im not as good
as like somebody that would do it  all the time
You know
I mean
H  X Oh X
I mean I trim horses
and stuff like that
but I mean
Im not like
H   Im not uh

H I dont know how to say it
But you know
they do it for a living
you know
most people that you would get to trim your horse do it  all the time
H and Im not Hx  that good or
and Im not very strong
Did they train you
yeah
Did they train you that
XX
yeah
yeah
So you have your own equipment
H
but
TSK H No
I dont have my own equipment at all
Dad
you know
has done some of it
Thats another thing too
is I kinda had a b general idea
H of kinda how to do it
just watching him
or
and watching
H people come to our place
and doing it and stuff you know
H  and
TSK  I dont know
then
down there
um
its mandatory
you have to
to graduate
you know
or well
to get the degree
you know
H  you have to take this class
H And you can only take
if you want to
you can only take it for eight weeks
H And
if you wanna go on in it
you n
then
you can go on
you know
And I decided to go ahead and go on in it
And the first part of it
is like
H well we have lecture
then we have lab
H  And like
the first part of it
we just go into the classroom
and he like
H  In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work
I mean
it
thats just kinda how it happens
you know
because he kinda has to tell you
H  they go over
the whole
the whole part  of the horse
I mean
H  all the skeleton  part of it you know
and
and they go through  every kinda ligament
and I mean
theres
H millions of ligaments
and millions of  tendons
you know
well not millions
but
I mean
yeah
I bet
H and X then X
so we had to know these tendons
and ligaments
H and then
all the bones
and
you know
all the way up from the shoulder down
and then from the hip down
You know
all the way down to the hoof
H and then
the bone in the hoof
and
H  then all the  wall
and
you know
of the hoof
and
what everything was called there
and then
H he went over on how to trim it
and where you
th theres a white line
that you go by
and a horse  has this little white line
H and you clean it out with the
TSK with the hoof knife
you know
H and then there
and then you can see this little white line
H and thats kinda where you go by
to
SM   you know
the horse kinda helps you out
because it
has that  little white line right there
mhm
and thats where you kinda SM
H kinda need a little guide
of where you trim
TSK H And
I am still scared to do it
because
you know
I mean
HI you can make HI a horse go lame
H By doing it
really
Well you can trim em too short
H And make em
you know
and theyre just  a little bit
for f
the first couple of days
you know
I mean theyre just  sore
H Thats not bad
but sometimes you can get it really bad
You can really make a horse really bad
H And they m
you know then
they have to
like
H keep em Hx
away from anything
you know
get em really in the soft ground
and
no  hard pebbles
or hard  clods of dirt or anything
H So
Hx TSK H I dont know
Im  a little scared  about doing it yet
you know
I get em really long
I mean theyre still long
When I get done with them
H SM A lot of times
like Ill get done
and Ill think Im done
and Ill look at
look down at the horses hoof SM
and its still
its too  long
H And then like
I would never
ever
ever
trust myself
to shoe a horse
See we did that too
we did
H We did a lot of stuff
we did a lot of stuff with the
like we had the
um
TSK the burners
you know
and youd put the
H youd have
you started out with the straight  iron
you know
H and youd stick it into the
into the
H you know like
SM actual blacksmithing
H And youd put it into the hot SM  coals
you know
H And then
wed
i i straight bar
and wed make it a
a horseshoe out of it
you know
H But

these shoes we never did put on a horse
H  We just put the shoes that were already made
THROAT
THROAT
on a horse
H  And thats as far as we got
I mean
if you would really get into it
H Well as a matter of fact
H this is really funny
You know
there isnt  really  any girl farriers  around anywhere
Theyre really
farrier
H  th Yeah
farrier is what theyre called
H And the m
the reason they were showing us this at college
was just
to get us
H to know if our trimmer
and shoer weres  doing it right
and
H plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments
which we
we had it in another class too
we
H that was kind of a double thing that
we had in
in another class
so it was kinda review for us
H well it was a review for some people
depend on what time of the year you took it
You know
H if it was a review or not
H But
TSK anyway
um
PARP what was I gonna say
I forgot what I was think
You said you never made the horseshoes
gonna say PPAR
but
H Well
w um
when we put em on a horses hoof
all we do
H theyre already made
theyre round
we pick out a size
you know wed
like look at the horses hoof
and say
okay
H this is a doubleaught
this is an aught
H this is
you know
what s
what size
and doubleaught and aught
are the  ones that are most popular
H   For
TSK you know
the light horse
You know
I mean
you get into the big horses
the
like the Clydesdales
Shires
thats a d
a whole different thing
H Or ponies
thats a whole different thing
H But were talking just the regular
light horses you know
H  And
aught and aught
X uh X aught
and doubleaught
are the two sizes
H Well anyway
you go get your
Okay
this is after you trimmed em
H And you go get your shoe
Its already made
Its already round
You pick out your size
H  You go look
and every horses hoof is shaped different
It doesnt matter
every horse is gonna have  a little  different shape
H  And so what you have to do
So every
every uh
horseshoe is made
custommade for the horse then
H No no
H No
What
What we do
then thats  thats where the ferrier comes in
H Every shoe
is like
you get order
you know
I would like a b case of doubleaught shoes
Youd get
H The ferrier gets em
You know
thats the way it goes
H  And then
TSK Our job
is to shape the shoe
to the horses foot
H And that
it d it sounds easy
but its really hard to do
I mean
H some of em you have to
you know
like say
okay
say your shoes  like this
H and your horses foot is just really wide or something
H Well then you have to put it on the anvil
and get the shoe stretched out
H well then once you stretch the shoe out
well then
H the two corners
they go out
too
you know
okay your shoes like this
H You stretch this out
well then its gonna make these go way out
too
and they get like this
Right
H then you have to round these back
you know
H Its just
it s it sounds easy
but its really hard to do
and then
H I would never do it
cause Id never trust myself to do it
H I mean we had to do it
THROAT
but
its just that people would volunteer their horses to the college
because
H  it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod
I mean
thats just how much it costs
Could you imagine all those horses out there
if we had em all shod
thats
How many have you got
H thirty bucks
for twenty horses
twenty
twentyeight horses
you know
H I mean
Jesus
that would be a th  nine hundred dollars
SNAP just SNAP like that
SM I mean
could you imagine SM
H So
w you know
like
a lot of people
that have a lot of horses and stuff
and that theyre riding a lot
theyll just
H  let the college kids do em
For em you know
H Theyre taking the risk
of having their horse  get lame
but
H  It really never happens
cause we have our s instructor right there
telling us
this is what you do
H And its not like
theres a person thats just gung ho
and goes and just
H trims their feet
and puts the shoe on
you know
you d you d you cant do that
And so we have our instructor right there
and we asked a million questions
all the time I mean
H he e
he just runs around
everywhere
you know
SWALLOW so its
H  But uh
PPAR What was I gonna say PARP
TSK  Oh
and its really tiring though
H And it
you know like
you get so
Ive  only done like
H  well Hx
at the end of the year
now see
I took the second half of the course
H And
right now
Ive probably
only shod about
five horses
H Trimmed a lot of em
H And you know what we start out with
This is the grossest of everything
X What X
H We start out
H  with
dead horse hooves
H I mean
you know
X the X the canneries
you know and stuff you know
The people that
H  that
kill the horses for meat and stuff
You know they have all these legs and stuff
H And
I dont know
everybody
I thought they used the THROAT the horsehooves in  for gelatin
Thats not so
H HI You know
I think they do HI
I think a lot of times
but
then they
they probably use em for everything
I dont know what all they use em for
H But anyway
we  TSK get  these horse hooves
from this one cannery
H they
they have to go
a long ways to go get em
like back East somewhere
to get these  horse hooves
H For the college
H They go back   East
and they get em
and they freeze em you know
H So we have this frozen horse hoof
that we have to start out on
cause you dont want to  cripple up a  H really good horse
and like
my first hoof
H  that horse would have been
lame
like crazy
H But
H it was just
and
oh
God
its so gross
because
H  sometimes if you get one thats been thawed out a little bit
they start really stinking and stuff
Oh
its the grossest thing
Oh
its just so icky
H HI I mean
you have this HI H  piece of horse
HI I mean this leg thats  HI
oh
its just gross
H And like in some of em
TSK blood will spurt out
you know
and I mean
oh
H Its nothing
SM H its the grossest thing SM
H And thats why
thats probably why they have to make that class mandatory
because at the beginning of the year
its just the
its the pits
H But once you get into it
its the funnest thing and
you know
its really interesting
to do stuff like that
H  But
I would have never got into that class
if
H theres no way
if I didnt have to have it
theres no way
I mean
H  I heard everybody saying um
you know
like the people that took the class before
H talking about
VOX Oh
you have to do this
you have to do that
theres dead horse hooves
you know you gotta
H and they stink VOX
and all this other stuff
and I was just going
Q oh my God
Im never
I dont want to take that class
so maybe Ill wait till next year Q
and then I thought
no
Ill get it out of the way now
H And then once I got into it
geez
I wanna take the second half of it
it was just really interesting to me
you know
H  But
Hx  TSK at first it was kind of a bummer
But
H Im glad I took it
Really glad
TSK It pays off
Especially
you know
H  twelve bucks
for a trim
I mean thats twelve bucks
every time I can go out
and trim my own horses hooves
Right
H You know
and I wouldnt trust myself to do it
with
a horse that I was really using a lot
or anything
but the ones that are standing around
H  thats still twelve dollars
you know
I mean whether the horse being used a lot or not
thats twelve bucks
and
H  shoot
I can do those
you know
But
I always have
anybody
H I always have somebody that really knows what theyre doing
for the horses that Im really really using
TSK H But anyway
TSK  I wanna wait until the morning
to do that
because
H Its just
too hot in the afternoon
to try to sit out there
H I mean you can get
just
exhausted
H Anyway
I was gonna tell you about that
the girl
you know
there isnt mary  very many
ferrier girls you know
And her heart
That do this
H This summer I met one
H Jorgensens
they have  one  shoer
that comes to their house
all the time
theyve had him for years and years and years
H And I guess like in Minnesota its real wet
and stuff you know
So like
they really have to watch their shoes
for not coming off
because the hoof wall
is so much softer
H Its like
when youre down there
your hands are softer and everything you know
and theyre not  as dry or anything
H When you get back here
we have dry hooves
we have to watch out for like uh
H  like the hooves being too dry
we have to put ointment on em and stuff
H The
Back there theyre too wet
H Not this time of the year
because
you know
theyve had a dry year
but
H usually theyre too wet
and that
that shoe can just pull right off
because its just
H  the hoof wall is so soft
Yeah
It seems weird
that thats like that
X
H you know
and I nei
I never knew that
until I took this class
either
I didnt realize that in
H you know
if you think about it
yeah
if it rains a lot
the horse is always wet
And its always moist
and its always on something moist
Yeah
TSK H Sure its gonna be softer
H But I never even thought about that until I took this class
So its
you know thats  kinda stuff too that you think about
H But anyway
TSK they always have this one horseshoer
and
H this girls been  in this ferrier
uh
shes going to an actual  ferrier college
H They have a lot of those around
a lot
H And shes going to one of em
and shes been going for
like nine months
to this one
and shes still got a lot more
X Where is the
uh X
H left to go
What
Where is the XX
Oh
Right here
Guess Ill put it on
its not on
XX
TSK But anyway
She has
um
H she
hes like taking her as a
you know
helping her out
and stuff
you know
for the summer
shes been working with him all summer
H And
its really different
to see a girl doing it
you know
you just  dont see that
AIRCONDITIONERFANBEGINS
at all
ever
H Jorgensens have a  girl
or a g
you know a guy
theyve had a guy being a horseshoer for
a long time you know
H And they
are um
TSK H theres this girl
thats working with him
for the summer
Unhunh
And shes gonna be a ferrier
Yeah
I couldnt believe it
HI And shes just little HI
Shes a tiny girl
but
boy I tell you
shes got arms the size of
H theyre huge
but she must only
HI What is m  blowing out of there HI
Well
thats what happens with that air conditioner
its just
it gets dust accumulated in it
see its all over the TV
It was just on last night
how does it get dust in it already
Well
I
It  Mae Lynne
for one thing the  filters are dirty because it  it so
been so dry
And the
it all comes acrost
the road
you know
and
and then it builds up real bad with
H COUGH deposits
out of the water
Oh
In other words I  should be  change filters
Ugh
God
I know
It wont last long
But
it sure does make a mess in the house
Yeah
it makes a mess
X I need X new filters
XX
Anyway
this girl must only weigh like
a hundred and ten pounds
H  I mean
shes just a little shit
and shes out there
and shes got huge arms
I mean shes in shape like you cant believe
H  Shes out there just
H  working away
And
those guys are so used to it
that they do it all day long
you know
Mhm
And that doesnt bother em a bit
to just go out there and
trim and trim and trim
H  And shoe
and everything
but
for me Hx
thats something Im not used to
and boy I tell you
H you just
sweat just rolls off of you
I just
H HI its HI tiring
The very
at the very beginning
when we first started doing it
we only did like one hoof
H Then we moved up to two
Then we moved up to a full horse
you know
H And
We were just slowly got in shape
doing that
you know
H But now if I went to do that
Holy smokes
Id never be able to handle it
TSK Why
Its just
its a
its hard work
It is really hard work
H  Youre bent over
and its
you know
it takes  like
I dont know why you sweat so bad doing it either
but you just
oh
its just
H  its just hard hard work
Its
H it doesnt seem like it would be
but
SWALLOW it is
Its really takes a lot of muscles to do it too
I mean a lot
H Those
Its hard
X You dont X get kicked a lot
TSK Ive never been kicked
ever
H But like
it those college h is course
you know
like I was talking
our horses are a little better than
H most peoples horse
cause theyve been around people a lot
H And they
they dont get by with stuff
I mean
we do get mad at our horses for
H you know
whatever they do wrong
we do get mad at em
TSK like I noticed
H horses at college
they just havent been disciplined enough
and theyre just
H its like a kid
theyre just
are ornery
you know
H And like
theyll move around
and
kinda be ornery about half way
but not  not too bad
Ive never been  kicked doing it at all
H And thats another thing we had to learn in the class you know
just had to learn  our safety of
H where to stand
and how to stand
H You have to stand like these certain ways
and
oh and its a killer on your back
cause youre standing like this
Oh Im sorry Berry
H Youre standing
MICROPHONE
Whoops
H
Youre standing like this you know
H And like
when youre in the back
the horses hoof  lays like this right over you
and youre
like this working
you know
H This is like a hoof knife
then a
you know
So youre always bent over
Youre always bent over
And like in the front
H You stick the horses hoof  between your leg
you know
TSK H Kinda like that
and you kinda
you go like this
you kinda bend down like this
and you have the horses hoof right here
E 	                              Its hard on your back
H Its really hard on your back
Like
I noticed that girls back muscles were just tremendous
too you know
Couldnt believe it
She had like on this  really  p kinda short shirt
you know
H
X Theres this X
H I think thats cold
E 	 Just dont
its
if you rub something against it
its just
Makes a sound
H Nkay
E 	 So what
what were you gonna do out there today
What other
what other things X were you X gonna
H Just go out and um
E 	 TSK Look at the filly
H Yeah
H  I think more or less Hx
its getting about
so late now
Pretty much all were gonna do is go out
I dont know what her plans really are
But I think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then
H maybe go to that  seasonal dance
or whatever it is
Is that what its called
E 	 I dont know
I dont know what its called either
H You know
he said there was four guys doing that
E 	 Doing what
The dance
you know
How he said theres four guys
I wonder if that means like
H Since theres four seasons
you know
I wonder if that has something to do with it
E 	            Unhunh
since he called it a seasonal dance
E 	                              XX
H  Hes a pretty neat guy
I thought
E 	  Yeah
he spoke Crow okay
H
H
I got a kick out of him when he kept saying it
H  See this little cat
Hx H  Little cat
E 	                I dont wanna see the little cat
I know
I know
E 	that sounds like kitten
that sounds like kit
E 	 I dont wanna  say kitten
that sounds stupid
H
E 	   H
So she named everybody in the class except for
E 	 TSK About  four people
Well
I think they asked for names
Oh did they
Hunh
Thats funny
H  Look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there
E 	 Yeah
I noticed on the
on the case for the tape recorder too
X that its all X
that its all covered today
Look right here
Look at your cigarettes even
E 	Look
Right here
Just
Geez
E 	just from sitting here
For just a minute
Thats
Look at the cigarettes
E 	 Its like ash
Is it from
that must be from the fires
Or what
You know
maybe it is
Maybe it is
E 	 Uh
Cause that one  whole day
you couldnt even see or anything
from
H but look at your cigarettes
Just sitting there
E 	    Oh yeah
On the way into r
from  Roundup
yesterday morning
the radio was on
And they were
talking about the weather and they said
H how we
everybody woke up with ash all over their car today
and
In Roundup
E 	 On the way from Roundup
I was listening to the radio
Yesterday morning
And they were talking
And so this was probably like a Billings radio station
or something like that
E 	   Yeah
Unhunh
H  Is that right
E 	And they said well everybody woke up with ashes on their car today
And I guess just from the fires
Yeah
it is
H
I was telling Mae Lynne
Hunh
Uh
day before yesterday
it was the most weird day Ive ever seen in my entire adult life
It was um
the wind was blowing real hot when I first got up
And it was early
Real early
like seven oclock in the morning
that
that wind was just hot
H And
next thing you knew
it was just overcast
well the smoke all blew in
Just like there was a fire
right around close
H And it was just  dense
You couldnt even hardly see
very far away
H Okay then
it
that
s
it just kinda blew the smoke in
and then blew it out
but
H then it was real hazy
and there was just dust particles
all over
and it was
H youd look at the sun
and it would just look red
I mean you couldnt see the sun
It was just
She said people were driving around with their lights on
Yeah
And the lights were
they didnt look like they were
its just from the drought and the dust
you know
and the smoke in the air
Ive never seen anything like it
And she said like
the lights looked  a greenish color
Yeah
They look a green XXXX
You know how they look yellow at night
you know
Yeah
they just looked green
It was a weird
ugly
ugly day
Rana Lees gonna have a baby by the way

Rana Lee
Rana Lee F
Unhunh
Rana Lee
E 	Hm
H
H  I dont know why I told you that
SING Rana Lee SING
H YWN She had a brother that died from asthma too YWN
Seem like a lot of people
I mean thats weird
that I would know two people that died from asthma
You know
Why dont we  go
E 	          just in
except
Just in a matter of a  years time
This washing is XXX
E 	 Really
Yeah
Her brother was like
H just right out of high school
H I mean
you know
did mom tell you
about Deb at all
She probably really couldnt
since Genetta was there
H You know
she was
like she was in the hospital
in and out of the hospital all the time and stuff
ever since she was little
H she was in and out of the hospital
Who was that
Debby
Debby
H I mean she was in
X
she H loved horses so much
XXXX X stuff on it X
H and she was always
like
H shes allergic to horsehair
horse sweat
E 	 Oh
X
You know
stuff like that
but she wouldnt quit riding em
so
Well XX
shes allergic to everything
it doesnt matter
XXX was saying
it didnt matter what she did
E 	 Did she ever go to a allergy doctor
XXXX
E 	 or anybody like that
H Oh yeah
She  t
H  well they
she never did take shots
Did she
No
I dont know why
They shouldve
they should have gotten her
I dont know why they didnt either
I
I w always wondered about that
and she was s
she had such severe asthma
that
H I would have done a little bit more for her I think
H If you wanna talk about somebody tired
that girl
that girl couldnt  walk down to the street and back
without taking a nap
And me and mom always accused her of being lazy
You know
because she was just
HI all she did was sleep HI
E 	 She sounded like she had more problems than
and now that when we think about it
she probably wasnt really  lazy
shes probably just exhausted
I mean
H you know
if you think about it
we like take  everything for granted
We take our air for granted
You know
Then somebody like that
every little breath is like  and effort to em
d
and you know
and if I had to go through an effort
just in breathing
all the time
H
Well Debby got
I would be tired too
Debby got to the point
where all she would do is
when she did
you know every
just
really often she would go H
to try to get enough air in
and her
they had an autopsy done on her
And her heart
was just hard
on one side
from
H labored breathing all of her life
It had just labored her heart so bad
H She actually died of a heart attack
She did
Yeah
They did have an autopsy done on her
Yes
It surprised me
But they
they did
And it was actually a
And her heart was hard
cardiac arrest
Mhm
H One side of her heart was just hard
from
the muscle
the muscle was just hard
from just  labored breathing
Geez
X trying to breathe all the time X
Thats just sick
Yeah
we thought she was just lazy
and kind of worthless
but
we didnt realize what she was going through
And you know Hx
maybe thats another reason why she didnt really
H maybe mom she kinda knew about all this stuff
And maybe thats why she didnt really
pay that much attention to Amanda
I mean not because
H I mean it seems like shed pay more attention to her
but maybe its because she wanted to have a little fun in her life too
